<h2>PROGRAM.</h2>

<br><br>


<p>The JOURNAL treats of the various branches of archæology and art history--Oriental,
Classic, Christian and Early Renaissance. Its original articles are predominantly
classic on account of the fact that it has become the official organ of the
ARCHÆOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA and of the AMERICAN SCHOOL OF CLASSICAL
STUDIES AT ATHENS, and the JOURNAL will aim to further the interests for
which the Institute and the School were founded. In it are published the reports
on all the excavations undertaken in Greece and elsewhere by the Institute and the
School, and the studies carried on independently by the Directors and members of
the School. By decision of the Council of the Archæological Institute the JOURNAL
has been distributed during 1893 to all members of the Institute, and the same
distribution will be made during 1894.</p>

<p>Beside articles the JOURNAL contains CORRESPONDENCE, BOOK NOTICES AND
REVIEWS AND ARCHÆOLOGICAL NEWS. It is its aim to give notices of all important
publications recently issued, sometimes written expressly for the JOURNAL, sometimes
summarized from authorized reviews in other publications.</p>

<p>The department in which the JOURNAL stands quite alone is the RECORD OF
DISCOVERIES AND INVESTIGATIONS. While all periods and all countries are represented,
special attention is given to Egypt, Greece and Italy. Not merely are the
results of actual excavations chronicled, but everything in the way of novel views
and investigations as expressed in books and periodicals is noted. In order to secure
thoroughness, more than one hundred periodicals are consulted and utilized. By
these various methods, all important work is concentrated and made accessible in a
convenient but scholarly form, equally suited to the specialist and to the general
reader.</p>

<p>It has been the aim of the editors that the JOURNAL, besides giving a survey of
the whole field of archæology, should be international in character. Its success in
this attempt is shown by the many noted European writers whose contributions
have appeared in its pages during the past eight years. Such are: MM. Babelon,
de Marsy, Maspero, Menant, Müntz and Reinach for France: MM. Dörpfeld,
Furtwängler, Hirschfeld, Michaelis, Mommsen, Schreiber and Wolters for Germany;
MM. Gardner, Murray, Pinches and Ramsay for England, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p>The JOURNAL is published quarterly and forms, each year, a volume of between
500 and 600 pages royal 8vo, illustrated with colored, heliotype, phototype, half-tone
and other plates and numerous figures. The yearly subscription is $5.00 for
<a name="pv" id="pv"></a><span class="pagenum">Page v</span>
America; and for countries of the Postal Union, 27 francs, 21 shillings or marks,
post-paid.</p>

<p>Vol. I, containing 489 pages, 11 plates and 16 figures; Vol. II, containing 521
pages; 14 plates and 46 figures; Vol. III, containing 531 pages, 33 plates and 19
figures; Vol. IV, containing 550 pages, 20 plates and 19 figures; Vol. V, containing

and 23 figures; Vol. VII, containing 578 pages; 26 plates and 8 figures; Vol.
VIII, containing 631 pages, 18 plates and 26 figures--will be sent bound for $5.50,
unbound for $5.00.</p>

<p>Vol. I has lately been out of print, but will be reprinted shortly in view of the
increasing demand for back volumes; all who desire to complete their sets should
send in their application.</p>

<h2>THE TEMPLE ON THE ACROPOLIS BURNT BY<br> THE PERSIANS.</h2>


<p>The excavations conducted by the Greek Archæological Society
at Athens from 1883 to 1889 have laid bare the entire surface of
the Acropolis, and shed an unexpected light upon the early history
of Attic art. Many questions which once seemed unanswerable
are now definitively answered, and, on the other hand, many
new questions have been raised. When, in 1886, Kabbadias and
Dörpfeld unearthed the foundations of a great temple close by the
southern side of the Erechtheion, all questions concerning the
exact site, the ground-plan, and the elevation of the great temple
of Athena of the sixth century B.C. were decided once for all.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a>
<a href="#footnote1"><sup class="sml">1</sup></a>
On these points little or nothing can be added to what has been
done, and Dörpfeld's results must be accepted as final and certain.</p>

<i>Antike Denkmäler</i>, I, pls. 1, 2; Description and discussion, <i>Mitth. Ath.</i>, XI, p. 337.</blockquote>

<p>The history of the temple presents, however, several questions,
some of which seem still undecided. When was the temple
built? Was it all built at one time? Was it restored after its
destruction by the Persians? Did it continue in use after the
erection of the Parthenon? Was it in existence in the days of
Pausanias? Did Pausanias mention it in his description of the
Acropolis? Conflicting answers to nearly all of these questions
have appeared since the discovery of the temple. Only the first
<a name="p2" id="p2"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 2</span>
question has received one and the same answer from all. The
material and the technical execution of the peripteros, entablature,
<i>etc.</i>, of the temple show conclusively that this part, at least, was
erected in the time of Peisistratos.<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a>
<a href="#footnote2"><sup class="sml">2</sup></a> We may therefore accept so
much without further discussion. Of the walls of the cella and
opisthodomos nothing remains, but the foundations of this part
are made of the hard blue limestone of the Acropolis, while
the foundations of the outer part are of reddish-gray limestone
from the Peiraieus. The foundations of the cella are also less
accurately laid than those of the peripteros. These differences
lead Dörpfeld to assume that the naos itself (the building contained
within the peristyle) existed before the time of Peisistratos,
although he does not deny the possibility that builders of one date
may have employed different materials and methods, as convenience
or economy dictated.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a>
<a href="#footnote3"><sup class="sml">3</sup></a> Positive proof is not to be hoped
for in the absence of the upper walls of the naos, but probability
is in favor of Dörpfeld's assumption, that the naos is older than
the peristyle, <i>etc.</i><a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a>
<a href="#footnote4"><sup class="sml">4</sup></a> It is further certain, that this temple was
called in the sixth century Β.C. το 'Εκατόμπεδον (see below p. 9).
So far, we have the most positive possible evidence--that of the
remains of the temple itself and the inscription giving its name.
The evidence regarding the subsequent history of the temple is
not so simple.</p>

<p>Dörpfeld (<i>Mitth. Ath.</i>, XII, p. 25 ff.) arrives at the following
conclusions: (1) The temple was restored after the departure of
the Persians; (2) it was injured by fire B.C. 406; (3) it was
repaired and continued in use; (4) it was seen and described by
Pausanias I. 24.3 in a lost passage. Let us take up these points
in inverse order. The passage of Pausanias reads in our texts:--Λέλκται
δέ μοι καί πρότρον (17.1), ώς Άθηναίοις περισσότερόν τι
ή τοις άλλοις ές τα θειά εστι σπουδης· πρώτοι μεν γαρ Άθηνάν
έπωνόμασαν Έργάνην, πρωτοι δ' άκώλους Έρμάς ... όμού δέ σφισιν
εν τω ναώ Σπουδαίων δαίμων εστίν. Dörpfeld marks a lacuna
between Έρμάς and όμού, as do those editors who do not supply a
<a name="p3" id="p3"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 3</span>
recommendation. Dörpfeld, however, thinks the gap is far greater than
has been supposed, including certainly the mention and probably
the full description of the temple under discussion. His reasons
are in substance about as follows: (1) Pausanias has reached a
point in his periegesis where he would naturally mention this
temple, because he is standing beside it,<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a>
<a href="#footnote5"><sup class="sml">5</sup></a> and (2) the phrase όμου
δέ σφισιν εν τω ναω Σπουδαίων δαίμων eστίν implies that a temple
has just been mentioned. These are, at least, the main arguments,
those deduced from the passage following the description of the
Erechtheion being merely accessory.</p>

<p>Now, if Pausanias followed precisely the route laid down for
him by Dörpfeld (<i>i.e.</i>, if he described the two rows of statues
between the Propylaia and the eastern front of the Parthenon,
taking first the southern and then the northern row), he would
come to stand where Dörpfeld suggests. If, however, he followed
some other order (<i>e.g.</i>, that suggested by Wernicke, <i>Mitth.</i>, XII,
p. 187), he would not be where Dörpfeld thinks. Pausanias does
not say that the statues he mentions are set up in two rows.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a>
<a href="#footnote6"><sup class="sml">6</sup></a> It
may be that the Acropolis was so thickly peopled with statues
that each side of the path was bordered with a double or triple
row, or that the statues were not arranged in rows at all, and
that Pausanias merely picks out from his memory (or his Polemon)
a few noticeable figures with only general reference to their relative
positions. Be this as it may, the assumption that Pausanias,
when he mentions the Σπουδαίων (or σπουδαιων?) δαίμων, is standing,
or imagines that he stands, beside the old temple rests upon
very slight foundations.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote5"
name="footnote5"></a><b>Footnote 5:</b><a href="#footnotetag5">
(return) </a> DÖRPFELD'S arguments for the continued existence of the temple, without which
his theory that Pausanias mentioned it must of course fall to the ground, will be
discussed below. It seemed to me advisable to discuss the Pausanias question first,
because, if he mentioned the temple, it must have existed, if not to his time, at least
to that of Polemon or of his other (unknown) authority.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote6"
name="footnote6"></a><b>Footnote 6:</b><a href="#footnotetag6">
(return) </a> The most than can be deduced from the use of πέραν (c. 24.1) is, that the statues
were on both sides of the path.</blockquote>

<p>Whether Pausanias, in what he says of Ergane, the legless
Hermæ, <i>etc.</i>, is, as Wernicke (<i>Mitth.</i>, XII, p. 185) would have it,
merely inserting a bit of misunderstood learning, is of little
moment. I am not one of those who picture to themselves
<a name="p4" id="p4"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 4</span>
Pausanias going about copying inscriptions, asking questions,
and forming his own judgments, referring only occasionally to
books when he wished to refresh his memory or look up some
matter of history. The labors of Kalkmann, Wilamowitz, and
others have shown conclusively, that a large part of Pausanias'
periegesis is adopted from the works of previous writers, and
adopted in some cases with little care by a man of no very striking
intellectual ability. It is convenient to speak as if Pausanias
visited all the places and saw all the things he describes, but it is
certain that he does not mention all he must in that case have
seen, and perhaps possible that he describes things he never can
have seen. Whether Pausanias travelled about Greece and then
wrote his description with the aid (largely employed) of previous
works, or wrote it without travelling, makes little difference
except when it is important to know the exact topographical
order of objects mentioned. In any case, however, his accuracy
in detail is hardly to be accepted without question, especially in
his description of the Acropolis, where he has to try his prentice
hand upon a material far too great for him. A useless bit of lore
stupidly applied may not be an impossibility for Pausanias, but,
however low our opinion of his intellect may be, he is the best we
have,<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a>
<a href="#footnote7"><sup class="sml">7</sup></a> and must be treated accordingly. The passage about
Ergane, <i>etc.</i>, must not be simply cast aside as misunderstood lore,
but neither should it be enriched by inserting the description of a
temple together with the state-treasury. The passage must be
explained without doing violence to the Ms. tradition. That this
is possible has lately been shown by A.W. Verrall.<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a>
<a href="#footnote8"><sup class="sml">8</sup></a>    He says:
<i>'What Pausanias actually says is this--:</i> "The Athenians are
specially distinguished by religious zeal. The name of Ergane
was first given by them, and the name Hermæ; and in the temple
along with them is a Good Fortune of the Zealous"<i>--words which
are quite as apt for the meaning above explained</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, a note on the
piety of the Athenians) <i>as those of the author often are in such cases.'</i></p>

not sure that a colorless verb has not fallen out after Έρμαs, though the assumption
of a gap is not strictly necessary, as Prof. Verrall shows.</blockquote>

<a name="p5" id="p5"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 5</span>

<p>Whether we read Σπουδαίων δαίμων or σπουδαίων Δαίμων is, for
our purposes immaterial. In either case, Verrall is right in calling
attention to the connection between ες τα θεΐα σπουδή and the
δαίμων Σπουδαίων (σπουδαίων), a connection which is now very
striking, but which is utterly lost by inserting the description of
a temple. At this point, then, the temple is not mentioned by
Pausanias.</p>

<p>But, if not at this point, perhaps elsewhere, for this also has
been tried. Miss Harrison<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a>

that the old άγαλμα bore the special appellation πολιάς, and we

to be sure, prove that the Erechtheion was also called, in whole or
in part ναός της πολιάδος (or της 'Αθήνας), but it awakens suspicion
to read of an ancient άγαλμα which we know was called Polias,
and which was perhaps the Polias κατ' εξοχήν, and immediately
after, with no introduction or explanation, to read of a temple of
Polias in which that άγαλμα is not. Nothing is known of a statue

<p>In the Erechtheion there was, then, a very ancient statue called Polias; in the temple beside
the Erechtheion was no statue about which anything is known,
and yet, according to Miss Harrison, the new found "old temple"
is the ναος της πολιάδος, while the πολιάς in bodily form dwells
next door. That seems to me an untenable position. Again, the
dog mentioned by Philochoros<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a>
<a href="#footnote14"><sup class="sml">14</sup></a> which went into the temple of
Polias, and, passing into the Pandroseion, lay down (δυσα εις το
πανδρόσειον ... κατέκειτο), can hardly have gone into the temple
alongside of the Erechtheion, because there was no means of passing
from the cella of that temple into the opisthodomos, and in
order to reach the Pandroseion the dog would have had to come
out from the temple by the door by which he entered it. The fact
that the dog went into this temple could have nothing to do with
his progress into the Pandroseion, whereas from the eastern cella
of the Erechtheion he could very well pass down through the lower
apartments and reach the Pandroseion. It seems after all that
when Pausanias says ναος της πολιάδος, he means the eastern cella
of the Erechtheion. But the ναος της Αθηνας is also the Erechtheion,
for E. Petersen has already observed (<i>Mitth.</i> XII, p. 63)
that, if the temple of Pandrosos was συνεχης τω ναω της Αθηνας,
the temple of Athena must be identified with the Erechtheion, not
with the temple beside it, for the reason that the temple of Pandrosos,
situated west of the Erechtheion, cannot be συνεχής
("adjoining" in the strict sense of the word) to the old temple,
which stood upon the higher level to the south. If Pausanias
had wished to pass from the Erechtheion to the temple of Athena
standing(?) beside it, the opening words of c. 26.6 (Ίερα μεν της
Αθηνς εστiν η τε αλλη πόλις κτέ.) would have formed the best
possible transition; but those words introduce the mention of the
ancient <i>αγαλμα</i> which was in the Erechtheion. That Pausanias
then, without any warning, jumps into another temple of Athena,
is something of which even his detractors would hardly accuse
him, and I hope I have shown that he is innocent of that offence.</p>

<p>Pausanias, then, does not mention the temple under discussion.</p>

<p>Xenophon (<i>Hell</i>.I. 6) says that, in the year 406 Β.C. ό παλαιος
ναος της Άθηνας ενεπρήσθη. Until recently this statement was
<a name="p7" id="p7"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 7</span>
supposed to apply to the Erechtheion, called "ancient temple"
because it took the place of the original temple of Athena, from
which the great temple (the Parthenon) was to be distinguished.
Of course, the new <i>building</i> of the Erechtheion was not properly
entitled to the epithet "ancient," but as a <i>temple</i> it could be called
ancient, being regarded as the original temple in renewed form.
If, however, the newly discovered temple was in existence alongside
the Erechtheion in 406, the expression παλαιὸς ναός applied to
the Erechtheion would be confusing, for the other temple was a
much older <i>building</i> than the Erechtheion. If the temple discovered
in 1886 existed in 406 B.C., it would be natural to suppose
that it was referred to by Xenophon as ὁ παλαιὸς ναός. But this
passage is not enough to prove that the temple existed in 406 B.C.</p>
<p>Demosthenes (xxiv, 136) speaks of a fire in the opisthodomos.
This is taken by Dörpfeld (<i>Mitth</i>., xii, p. 44) as a reference to the
opisthodomos of the temple under discussion, and this fire is identified
with the fire mentioned by Xenophon. But hitherto the
opisthodomos in question has been supposed to be the rear part
of the Parthenon, and there is no direct proof that Demosthenes
and Xenophon refer to the same fire. If the temple discovered in
1886 existed in 406 B.C., it is highly probable that the passages
mentioned refer to it, but the passages do not prove that it existed.</p>

<p>It remains for us to sift the evidence for the existence of the
temple from the Persian War to 406 B.C. This has been collected
by Dörpfeld<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a>
<a href="#footnote15"><sup class="sml">15</sup></a> and Lolling,<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a>
<a href="#footnote16"><sup class="sml">16</sup></a> who agree in thinking that
the temple continued in existence throughout the fifth and fourth
centuries, however much their views differ in other respects. But
it seems to me that even thus much is not proved. I believe that,
after the departure of the Persians, the Athenians partially restored
the temple as soon as possible, because I do not see how they could
have got along without it, inasmuch as it was used as the public
treasury; but my belief, being founded upon little or no positive
evidence, does not claim the force of proof.</p>

<p>Dörpfeld (XV, p. 424) says that the Persians left the walls of the
temple and the outer portico standing; that this is evident "from
the present condition of the architraves, triglyphs and cornices,
which are built into the Acropolis wall. These architectural members
were ... taken from the building while it still stood,
and built into the northern wall of the citadel."But, if the
Athenians had wished to restore the temple as quickly as possible,
they would have left these members where they were. It seems,
at least, rather extravagant to take them carefully away and then
restore the temple without a peristyle, for the restored building
would probably need at least cornices if not triglyphs or architraves;
then why not repair the old ones? It appears by no
means impossible that, as Lolling (p. 655) suggests, only a part of
the temple was restored.<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a>
<a href="#footnote17"><sup class="sml">17</sup></a> Still more natural is the assumption,
that the Athenians carried off the whole temple while they were
about it. I do not, however, dare to proceed to this assumption,
because I do not know where the Athenians would have kept
their public monies if the entire building had been removed.
Perhaps part of the peristyle was so badly injured by the Persians
that it could not be repaired. At any rate, the Athenians intended
(as Dörpfeld, XII, p. 202, also believes) to remove the whole building
so soon as the great new temple should be completed. I think
they carried out their intention.</p>

western half of the temple was restored. DÖRPFELD, p. 425, suggests the possibility
that the entire building, even the peristyle, was restored, and that the peristyle
remained until the erection of the Erechtheion.</blockquote>

<p>This brings us to the discussion of the names and uses of the
various parts of the older temple and of the new one (the Parthenon),
the evidence for the continued existence of the older temple
being based upon the occurrence of these names in inscriptions
and elsewhere. As these matters have been fully discussed by
Dörpfeld and Lolling, I shall accept as facts without further discussion
all points which seem to me to have been definitively
settled by them.</p>

<a name="p9" id="p9"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 9</span>

<p>Lolling, in the article referred to above, publishes an inscription
put together by him from forty-one fragments. It belongs to the
last quarter of the sixth century B.C., and relates to the pre-Persian
temple. Part of the inscription is too fragmentary to admit
of interpretation, but the meaning of the greater part (republished
by Dörpfeld) is clear at least in a general way. The ταμίαι are
to make a list of certain objects on the Acropolis with certain
exceptions. The servants of the temple, priests, <i>etc</i>., are to follow
certain rules or be punished by fines. The ταμίαι are to open in
person the doors of the chambers in the temple. These rules
would not concern us except for the fact that the various parts of
the building are mentioned. The whole building is called το Έκατόμπεδον;
parts of it are the προνήϊον, the νεώς, the οίκημα ταμιείον
and τα οίκήματα. There can be no doubt that these are respectively
the eastern porch, the main cella, the large western room and the
two smaller chambers of the pre-Persian temple. But most
important of all is the fact that the whole building was called in
the sixth century B.C. το Έκατόμπεδον. The word οπισθόδομος
does not occur in the inscription, and we cannot tell whether the
western half of the building was called opisthodomos in the sixth
century or not. Very likely it was.</p>

<p>Lolling (p. 637) says: "No one, I think, will doubt that το
Έκατόμπεδον is the νεως ό Έκατόμπεδος often mentioned in the
inscriptions of the ταμίαι and elsewhere." If this is correct, the
eastern cella of the Parthenon cannot be the νεως ό Έκατόμπεδος.
Lolling maintains that the eastern cella of the Parthenon was the
<i>Parthenon</i> proper, that the western room of the Parthenon was the
opisthodomos, and that the νεως ό Έκατόμπεδος was the pre-Persian
temple. Besides the official name Έκατόμπεδον or νεως ό Έκατόμπεδος,
Lolling thinks the pre-Persian temple was also called αρχαιος
(παλαιος) νεώς.<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a>
<a href="#footnote18"><sup class="sml">18</sup></a> Dörpfeld maintains that the western cella of the
Parthenon was the <i>Parthenon</i> proper, the western part of the "old
temple" was the opisthodomos, and the eastern cella of the Parthenon
<a name="p10" id="p10"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 10</span>
was the <i>νεως ό Έκατόμπεδος</i>, leaving the question undecided
whether the "old temple" was still called <i>το Έκατόμπεδον</i> in the
fifth century, but laying great stress upon the difference in the
expressions το Έκατόμπεδον and ό νεως ό Έκατόμπεδος.<a id="footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a>
<a href="#footnote19"><sup class="sml">19</sup></a> Both

<p>Among the objects mentioned in the lists of treasure handed

statue is gold and ivory. The only gold and ivory statue of
Athena on the Acropolis was, so far as is known, the so-called
<i>Parthenos</i> of Pheidias. Those inscriptions therefore prove that
the Parthenos stood in the Hekatompedos (or Hekatompedon);
that is, that the eastern cella of the Parthenon was called <i>Έκατόμπεδος (ον)</i>
in the fifth century.<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a>

<p>When the Athenians built the great western room of the Parthenon,
they certainly did not intend it to serve merely as a
store-room for the objects described in the transmission-lists as
<i>εν τω Παρθενωνι</i> or <i>εκ του Παρθενωνος</i>, these being mostly of little
value or broken.<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a>
<a href="#footnote22"><sup class="sml">22</sup></a> Now the treasury of Athens was the opisthodomos,
and the western room of the Parthenon was, from the
moment of the completion of the building, the greatest opisthodomos
in Athens. It is natural to regard this (with Lolling) as
<a name="p11" id="p11"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 11</span>
the opisthodomos where the treasure was kept. This room was
doubtless divided into three parts by two partitions of some sort,
probably of metal,<a id="footnotetag23" name="footnotetag23"></a>
<a href="#footnote23"><sup class="sml">23</sup></a> running from the eastern and western wall to
the nearest columns and connecting the columns. This arrangement
agrees with the provision (<i>CIA</i>, I, 32) that the monies of
Athena be cared for έv τω έπι δεξια του όπισθοδόμου, those of the
other gods έv τω eπ' άριοτερά. Until the completion of the Parthenon,
the opisthodomos of the pre-Persian temple might properly
be <i>the</i> opisthodomos κατ' εξοχήν, but so soon as the Parthenon
was finished, the new treasure-house would naturally usurp the
name as well as the functions of its predecessor.</p>

<p>But, if the western room of the Periclean temple was the
opisthodomos, where was the Παρθενών proper? It cannot be
identical with the νεώς ό Έκατόμπεδος nor with the opisthodomos,
for the three appellations occur at the same date evidently
designating three different places. It would be easier to tell
where the Παρθενών proper was, if we knew why it was called
Παρθενών. The name was in all probability not derived from the
Parthenos, but rather the statue was named from the <i>Parthenon</i>
after the latter appellation had been extended to the whole building,
for there is no evidence that the great statue was called
Parthenos from the first. Its official title was, so far as is known,
never Parthenos.<a id="footnotetag24" name="footnotetag24"></a>
<a href="#footnote24"><sup class="sml">24</sup></a> The Parthenon was not so named because it
contained the Parthenos, but why it was so named we do not
know. The πρόνεως is certainly the front porch, the Έκατόμπεδος
νεώς is certainly the cella, 100 feet long, the οπισθόδομος is the
rear apartment (of some building, even if I have not made it seem
probable that it is the rear apartment of the Parthenon). These
names carry their explanation with them. But the name Παρθενών
gives us no information. It was a part of the great Periclean
temple, for the name was in later times applied to the whole
building, and the only part of the building not named is the
western porch. It is, however, incredible that the Athenians
should use this porch, so prominently exposed to the eyes of
<a name="p12" id="p12"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 12</span>
every sight-seer, as a storehouse for festival apparatus, <i>etc</i>. It is
more probable that the Παρθενών proper was within the walls of
the building but separated from the other parts in some way.
The middle division of the western room, separated by columns
and metal partitions from the treasury of Athena on the right
and that of the other gods on the left, was large enough and,
being directly in front of the western door, prominent enough, to
deserve a name of its own. If this room was the Παρθενών proper,
it is evident that a fire in the opisthodomos would cause the
Παρθενών to be emptied of its contents, which would then naturally
be inventoried as εκ του Παρθενώνος, while another list could properly
be headed εκ του οπισθοδομον referring to the treasure-chambers.<a id="footnotetag25" name="footnotetag25"></a>
<a href="#footnote25"><sup class="sml">25</sup></a>
The name Parthenon might then be extended first
to the entire western part of the building and then to the whole
edifice. This is not a <i>proof</i> that the Παρθενών was the central part
of the western room of the great temple. A complete proof is
impossible. All I claim is that this hypothesis fulfils all the
necessary conditions.</p>

explanation given above seems equally possible. Dörpfeld, (Mitth., vi, p. 283, ff.)
proved conclusively that the Παρθενών was not the eastern cella of the Parthenon.
His proof that it was the great western room is based primarily upon the assumption
(p. 300) that <i>Der Name Opisthodom bezeichnet hei alien Tempeln die dem Pronaos entsprechende Hinterhalle</i>. But for that assumption the Παρθενών might just as well
be the western porch. Since the discovery of the pre-Persian temple, however,
Dörpfeld maintains that the opisthodomos κατ εξοχήν was the entire western portion
of that temple, consisting of three rooms besides the porch (though he does not
expressly include the porch). There is, then, no reason in the nature of things why
the whole western part of the Parthenon should not be called opisthodomos.</blockquote>

<p>Let us now compare the nomenclature of the pre-Persian and
Periclean temples. Both were temples of Athena and more especially
of Athena as guardian of the city, Athena Polias; a <i>pronaos</i>
or <i>proneion</i> formed part of each; one temple was called το Έκατόμεδον,
and the main cella of the other was called ό Έκατομπεδοs
νεως<a id="footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a>
<a href="#footnote26"><sup class="sml">26</sup></a>, and this name was extended to the whole building. An
opisthodomos was a part of each building, and, if I was right in
<a name="p13" id="p13"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 13</span>
my observations above, the new one, like the old, was called
simply ο οπισθόδομος. As soon as the great Periclean temple was
completed, the temple burnt by the Persians was quietly removed
as had been intended from the first, the treasure was deposited in
the great new opisthodomos, the old ceremonies which might still
cling to the temple of the sixth century were transferred, along
with the old names, to the splendid new building; the greatest
temple on the Acropolis was now as before the house of the patron
goddess of the land, and contained her treasure and that of her
faithful worshippers, but the two temples did not exist side by side.
There was, then, no reason for differentiating between the two
temples, as, for instance, by calling the one that had been removed
ό αρχαίος veas, because the one that had been removed
was no longer in existence. That the designation αρχαίος
(παλαιός) νεώς is applicable to the Erechtheion has been accepted
for many years and has been explained anew by Petersen.<a id="footnotetag27" name="footnotetag27"></a>
<a href="#footnote27"><sup class="sml">27</sup></a> If the
temple burnt by the Persians had continued to exist alongside
of the Parthenon, one might doubt whether it or the Erechtheion
was meant by the expression ό αρχαίος νεώς, but if one of the two
temples was no longer in existence, the name must belong to the
other. It is just possible that in Hesychios, 'Εκατό μπεδος· νεώς ev
τη άκροπόλεί τη Παρθενω κατασκευασθείς υπό Αθηναίων, μείζων του
εμπρησθεντος υπό των Περσών ποσΐ πεντήκοντα, the expression
του έμπρησθεντος υπό των Περσών (yea or possibly 'Εκατόμπέδου
νεώ) was originally chosen because the expression αρχαίου νεώ
(which would otherwise be very appropriate here) was regularly
used to designate the Erechtheion.<a id="footnotetag28" name="footnotetag28"></a>

misleading, but sometimes furnishes a useful illustration. There is in
Boston, Mass., a church called the <i>Old South</i> church. This became too small and
too inconvenient for its congregation, so a new church was built in a distant part of
the city. The intention then was to destroy the old building, in which case the
new one (though new and in a different part of the city) would have been called the
Old South church. The old building was, however, preserved, and the new one now
goes by the name of the New Old South church, though I have also heard it called
the Old South in spite of the continued existence of the old building. So the new
building of the Erechtheion retained the name άρχαιος νεως which had belonged
to its predecessor on the same spot.</blockquote>

thinks, however, (p. 641) that Hesychios would not compare the two unless they
had both been standing at the same time. Possibly any inaccuracy may be accounted
for by the fact that the older temple was no longer standing when the comparison
was first made. Possibly, too, the name Hekatompedon was not originally meant
to be taken quite literally, but rather, as Curtitis, <i>Stadtgeschichte,</i> p. 72, seems to
think, as a proud designation of a grand new building.</blockquote>

<p>At the end of his last article on this subject, Dörpfeld calls
attention to the fact that "not only the lower step (<i>Unterstufe</i>) of
the temple, but also a stone of the stylobate are still in their old
position, and several stylobate-stones are still lying about upon
the temple," and says that the whole stylobate, with the exception
of the part cut away by the Erechtheion, must therefore have
existed in Roman times. I do not see why quite so much is to be
assumed. Even granting that we know the exact level of the
surface of the Acropolis in classical times at every point, we certainly
do not know all the objects--votive offerings and the like--set
up in various places. Some small part of the stylobate of the
ruined temple may have been used as a foundation for some group
of statuary or other offering,<a id="footnotetag29" name="footnotetag29"></a>
<a href="#footnote29"><sup class="sml">29</sup></a> or a fragment of the building itself
may have been left as a reminder to future generations of the
devastations of the barbarians. The existence of these stones is
called by Dörpfeld "a fact hitherto insufficiently considered"
(<i>eine bishеr nicht genügend beаchtete Thatsache</i>). I cannot believe
that the fact would have remained so long "insufficiently considered"
by Dörpfeld and others if it were really in itself a sufficient
proof that the pre-Persian temple continued in existence until the
end of ancient Athens. If I am right in thinking that the temple
did not exist during the last centuries of classical antiquity, it
must have ceased to exist when the Parthenon was completed.
Dörpfeld is certainly justified in saying<a id="footnotetag30" name="footnotetag30"></a>
<a href="#footnote30"><sup class="sml">30</sup></a> that "he who concedes
the continued existence of the temple until the end of the fourth

<p>In the above discussion I have purposely passed over some
points because I wished to confine myself to what was necessary.
So I have not reviewed in detail the passages containing the

<p>To recapitulate briefly, I hope that I have shown: (1) that
Pausanias does not mention the temple excavated in 1886, and
(2) that the existence of that temple during the latter part of the
fifth and the fourth centuries is not proved. I believe that the
temple continued to exist in some form until the completion of
the Parthenon, but this belief is founded not so much upon documentary
evidence as upon the consideration that the Athenians
and their goddess must have had a treasure-house during the time
from the Persian invasion to the completion of the Parthenon;
especially after the treasure of the confederacy of Delos was moved
to Athens in 454 B.C. As soon, however, as the Parthenon was
completed, the temple burnt by the Persians was removed. This
was before the fire of 406 B.C. The fire, therefore, injured, as
has been supposed hitherto, the Erechtheion. The opisthodomos,
which was injured by fire at some time not definitely ascertained
(but probably not very far from the date of the fire in the Erechtheion),
was the opisthodomos of the Parthenon.</p>



<p>It will, I hope, be observed, that I do not claim to have <i>proved</i>
the non-existence of the earlier temple after the completion of the
Parthenon. All I claim is that its existence is not proved. Now
<a name="p16" id="p16"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 16</span>
if, as I hope I have shown, the temple is not mentioned by
Pausanias,<a id="footnotetag35" name="footnotetag35"></a>
<a href="#footnote35"><sup class="sml">35</sup></a>
and there is no reasonable likelihood of its silent disappearance
between 435 B.C. and the time of Pausanias, the
probabilities are in favor of its disappearance about 435 B.C.,
when it was supplanted by the Parthenon. No one, however,
would welcome more gladly than I any further evidence either
for or against its continued existence.</p>

<p>POSTSCRIPT.--This article had already left my hands when I
received the <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i> (XII. 2), containing an article
by Mr. Penrose, <i>On the Ancient Hecatompedon which occupied the
site of the Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens</i>. Mr. Penrose contends
that the old Hekatompedon was a temple of unusual length
in proportion to its width, that it stood on the site of the Parthenon,
and was built 100 years or more before the Persian invasion.
He thinks, too, that the Doric architectural members built into
the Acropolis-wall, which are referred by Dörpfeld to the archaic
temple beside the Erechtheion, belonged to the building on the
site of the Parthenon. He is led to these assumptions chiefly by
masons' marks on some of the stones of the sub-structure of the
Parthenon. He holds it "as incontrovertible that the marks have
reference to the building on which they are found." The distances
between these marks offer certain numerical relations which must,
Mr. Penrose thinks, correspond to some of the dimensions of the
building to which the marks refer. "If they had reference to the
Parthenon, they would have shown a number of exact coincidences
with the important sub-divisions of the temple." Of these coincidences
Mr. Penrose has found but three, which he considers
fortuitous. As accessory arguments he adduces the condition of
the filling in to the south of the Parthenon, and the absence of
<a name="p17" id="p17"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 17</span>
old architectural material in the sub-structure of the Parthenon,
<i>etc</i>. He seems, however, to rest his case chiefly upon the masons'
marks.</p>

<p>I cannot even attempt to discuss this new theory in detail, but
would mention one or two things which seem to tell against Mr.
Penrose's view. The inscription published by Lolling mentions
an <i>οίκημα ταμιείον</i> and <i>οίκήματα</i> as parts of the Hekatompedon,
and such apartments evidently existed in the temple beside the
Erechtheion. Mr. Penrose assumes that the temple beside the
Erechtheion antedates his Hekatompedon, without regard to the
fact that the use of the stone employed in the outer foundations
of the archaic temple points to a much later period. The archaic
temple was (at least approximately) 100 feet long, which makes
it seem almost impossible that a new temple should be built on
the Acropolis and called the Hundred-foot-temple (Hekatompedon).
I cannot avoid attaching more importance to these considerations
than to the arguments advanced by Mr. Penrose. It may
be, however, that answers to these and other objections will be
found.</p>

<p>If Mr. Penrose's theory is correct, it is evident that the old
Hekatompedon must have ceased to exist before the building of
the Parthenon. Whether the archaic temple excavated in 1886
continued to exist or not is, then, another matter. My main contention
(that there is no good reason for assuming the continued
existence through the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. of the archaic
temple) is not affected by Mr. Penrose's theory, and I leave my
arguments, such as they are, for the consideration alike of those
who do and who do not agree with Mr. Penrose. Much of my
article will appear irrelevant to the former class, but, as Mr.
Penrose's views may not be at once generally accepted, it is as
well to leave the discussion of previous theories as it was before
the appearance of Mr. Penrose's article.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON THE SUBJECTS OF GREEK TEMPLE<br>
SCULPTURES.</h3>


<p>The following compilation is intended to present in compact
form the evidence at present available on this question: How far
did the Greeks choose, for the sculptured decorations of a temple,
subjects connected with the principal divinity or divinities worshiped
in that temple? We have omitted some examples of
sculpture in very exceptional situations, <i>e.g.</i>, the sculptured drums
of the sixth century and fourth century temples of Artemis at
Ephesos. Acroteria have also been omitted. But we have
attempted to include every Greek temple known to have had
pediment-figures or sculptured metopes or frieze, and have thus,
for the sake of completeness, registered some examples which are
valueless for the main question. The groups from Delos, attributed
on their first discovery to the pediments of the Apollon-temple,
have been proved by Furtwängler to have been acroteria (<i>Arch,
Zeitung</i>, 1882, p. 336 ff.) It does not appear that Lebas had any
good grounds for attributing to a temple the relief found by him
at Rhamnus (<i>Voyage archéologique Monuments figurés</i>, No. 19,) and
now in Munich. The frieze from Priene representing a gigantomachy
was not a part of the temple there (Wolters, <i>Jahrbuch des
deutschen arch. Instituts</i>, I, pp. 56, ff.) The Poseidon and Amphitrite
frieze in Munich (Brunn, <i>Beschreibung der Glyptothek</i>, No. 115)
has been, by some, taken for a piece of temple decoration, but is
too doubtful an example to be catalogued. The statement of
Pausanias (II. 11. 8) about the pediment-sculptures (<i>τà έν τοίς
àετοίς</i>) of the Asklepieion at Titane is hopelessly inadequate and
perhaps inaccurate.</p>

<p>The order of arrangement in the following table is roughly
chronological, absolute precision being impossible. Ionic temples
<a name="p19" id="p19"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 19</span>
are designated by a prefixed asterisk, the one Corinthian by
a dagger. The others are Doric, and, in the ease of these,
"Sculptures of the Exterior Frieze" refers, of course, to sculptured
metopes.</p>

<p>It has not been our purpose to discuss at length the conclusions
to be drawn from this evidence. Briefly, the results may be
summarized as follows:</p>

<p>The principal sculpture (<i>i.e.</i>, sculpture of the principal pediment,
or, in the absence of pediment-sculpture, the frieze in the
most important situation) included the figure of the temple
divinity, generally in central position, in the following numbers:
<a id="footnotetagA" name="footnotetagA"></a>
<a href="#footnoteA"><sup class="sml">A</sup></a> 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 26. If 12, 14 and 32 had no pediment-sculptures,
they should be added; probably also 33 and 34.
In 30 the subject of the pediment-sculpture, if correctly divined by
Conze, was, at any rate, closely related to the temple-divinities.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnoteA"
name="footnoteA"></a><b>Footnote A:</b><a href="#footnotetagA">
(return) </a> In counting the Aigina temple we commit deliberately a <i>circulus in probando</i>.</blockquote>

<p>The principal sculpture apparently did not include or especially
refer to the temple-divinity in the following: 20, 24, 25. Practice
would seem to have become somewhat relaxed after about 425
B.C. The very singular temple of Assos, (No. 5), though earlier,
should perhaps be added.

<p>The temple-divinity was represented in the western pediments
of 7, 13 and perhaps of 20, but not of that in 9, 11, 24 (?) or 25.</p>

<p>The subjects of sculptured metopes and friezes were largely or
wholly without obvious relation to the temple-divinity in the
following: 1, 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 1.9, 23, 29, 32.</p>

the designation given above rests solely on the prominence given to Athena in
the pediment-sculptures. As for the date, the building is assigned by Dörpfeld
to the sixth cent. (<i>Olympia</i>, <i>Textband</i> II, p. 20). The pediment-sculptures

not take place till after 479. According to Pausanias, the pediment-sculptures
were the work of Praxias and Androsthenes. These sculptures have been
generally supposed to have been executed about 424, but may have been considerably
earlier, so far as Pausanias goes to show. The excavations now in

<h3>PAPERS OF THE AMERICAN SCHOOL OF CLASSICAL<br>

THE RELATION OF THE ARCHAIC PEDIMENT<br>

VASE-PAINTING.</h3>

<p>From one point of view it is a misfortune in the study of
archæology that, with the progress of excavation, fresh discoveries
are continually being made. If only the evidence of the facts were
all in, the case might be summed up and a final judgment pronounced
on points in dispute. As it is, the ablest scholar must
feel cautious about expressing a decided opinion; for the whole
fabric of his argument may be overturned any day by the unearthing
of a fragment of pottery or a sculptured head. Years ago, it
was easy to demonstrate the absurdity of any theory of polychrome
decoration. The few who dared to believe that the Greek temple
was not in every part as white as the original marble subjected
themselves to the pitying scorn of their fellows. Only the discoveries
of recent years have brought proof too positive to be gainsaid.
The process of unlearning and throwing over old and
cherished notions is always hard; perhaps it has been especially so
in archæology.</p>

<p>The thorough investigation of the soil and rock of the Acropolis
lately finished by the Greek Government has brought to light
so much that is new and strange that definite explanations and
conclusions are still far away. The pediment-reliefs in poros
which now occupy the second and third rooms of the Acropolis
Museum have already been somewhat fully treated, especially in
their architectural bearings. Dr. Brückner of the German Institute
<a name="p29" id="p29"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 29</span>
has written a full monograph on the subject,<a id="footnotetag36" name="footnotetag36"></a>
<a href="#footnote36"><sup class="sml">36</sup></a> and it has also been
fully treated by Lechat in the <i>Revue Archeologique</i>.<a id="footnotetag37" name="footnotetag37"></a>
<a href="#footnote37"><sup class="sml">37</sup></a> Shorter papers
have appeared in the <i>Mittheilungen</i> by Studniczka<a id="footnotetag38" name="footnotetag38"></a>
<a href="#footnote38"><sup class="sml">38</sup></a> and P.J.
Meier.<a id="footnotetag39" name="footnotetag39"></a>
<a href="#footnote39"><sup class="sml">39</sup></a> Dr. Waldstein in a recent peripatetic lecture suggested a
new point of view in the connection between these reliefs and Greek
vase-paintings. It is this suggestion that I have tried to follow
out.</p>

<p>The groups in question are too well known to need a detailed
description here. The first,<a id="footnotetag40" name="footnotetag40"></a>
<a href="#footnote40"><sup class="sml">40</sup></a> in a fairly good state of preservation,
represents Herakles in his conflict with the Hydra, and at the left
Iolaos, his charioteer, as a spectator. Corresponding to this, is the
second group,<a id="footnotetag41" name="footnotetag41"></a>
<a href="#footnote41"><sup class="sml">41</sup></a> with Herakles overpowering the Triton; but the
whole of this is so damaged that it is scarcely recognizable. Then
there are two larger pediments in much higher relief, the one<a id="footnotetag42" name="footnotetag42"></a>
<a href="#footnote42"><sup class="sml">42</sup></a>
repeating the scene of Herakles and the Triton, the other<a id="footnotetag43" name="footnotetag43"></a>
<a href="#footnote43"><sup class="sml">43</sup></a> representing
the three-headed Typhon in conflict, as supposed, with
Zeus. All four of these groups have been reconstructed from a
great number of fragments. Many more pieces which are to be
seen in these two rooms of the Museum surely belonged to the
original works, though their relations and position cannot be determined.
The circumstances of their discovery between the south
supporting-wall of the Parthenon and Kimon's inner Acropolis
wall make it certain that we are dealing with pre-Persian art. It
is quite as certain, in spite of the fragmentary condition of the
remains, that they were pedimental compositions and the earliest
of the kind yet known.</p>

<p>The first question which presents itself in the present consideration
is: Why should these pedimental groups follow vase paintings?
We might say that in vases we have practically the first
products of Greek art; and further we might show resemblances,
more or less material, between these archaic reliefs and vase pictures.
But the proof of any connection between the two would
still be wanting. Here the discoveries made by the Germans at
<a name="p30" id="p30"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 30</span>
Olympia and confirmed by later researches in Sicily and Magna
Graecia, are of the utmost importance.<a id="footnotetag44" name="footnotetag44"></a>
<a href="#footnote44"><sup class="sml">44</sup></a> In the Byzantine west
wall at Olympia were found great numbers of painted terracotta
plates<a id="footnotetag45" name="footnotetag45"></a>
<a href="#footnote45"><sup class="sml">45</sup></a> which examination proved to have covered the cornices of
the Geloan Treasury. They were fastened to the stone by iron
nails, the distance between the nail-holes in terracottas and cornice
blocks corresponding exactly. The fact that the stone, where
covered, was only roughly worked made the connection still more
sure. These plates were used on the cornice of the long side, and
bounded the pediment space above and below. The corresponding
cyma was of the same material and similarly decorated.</p>

<p>It seems surprising that such a terracotta sheathing should be
applied on a structure of stone. For a wooden building, on the
other hand, it would be altogether natural. It was possible to
protect wooden columns, architraves and triglyphs from the weather
by means of a wide cornice. But the cornice itself could not but
be exposed, and so this means of protection was devised. Of
course no visible proof of all this is at hand in the shape of wooden
temples yet remaining. But Dr. Dörpfeld's demonstration<a id="footnotetag46" name="footnotetag46"></a>
<a href="#footnote46"><sup class="sml">46</sup></a> removes
all possible doubt. Pausanias<a id="footnotetag47" name="footnotetag47"></a>
<a href="#footnote47"><sup class="sml">47</sup></a> tells us that in the Heraion
at Olympia there was still preserved in his day an old wooden
column. Now from the same temple no trace of architrave, triglyph
or cornice has been found; a fact that is true of no other
building in Olympia and seems to make it certain that here wood
never was replaced by stone. When temples came to be built of
stone, it seems that this plan of terracotta covering was retained
for a time, partly from habit, partly because of its fine decorative
effect. But it was soon found that marble was capable of withstanding
the wear of weather and that the ornament could be applied
to it directly by painting.</p>

<p>In order to carry the investigation a step further Messrs.
Dörpfeld, Gräber, Borrmann and Siebold undertook a journey
to Gela and the neighboring cities of Sicily and Magna Graecia.<a id="footnotetag48" name="footnotetag48"></a>
<a href="#footnote48"><sup class="sml">48</sup></a>
The results of this journey were most satisfactory. Not only
in Gela, but in Syracuse, Selinous, Akrai, Kroton, Metapontum
and Paestum, precisely similar terracottas were found to have
been employed in the same way. Furthermore just such cyma
pieces have been discovered belonging to other structures in Olympia
and amid the pre-Persian ruins on the Acropolis of Athens.
It is not yet proven that this method of decoration was universal
or even widespread in Greece; but of course the fragile nature of
terracotta and the fact that it was employed only in the oldest
structures, would make discoveries rare.</p>

<p>Another important argument is furnished by the certain use of
terracotta plates as acroteria. Pausanias<a id="footnotetag49" name="footnotetag49"></a>
<a href="#footnote49"><sup class="sml">49</sup></a> mentions such acroteria
on the Stoa Basileios on the agora of Athens. Pliny<a id="footnotetag50" name="footnotetag50"></a>
<a href="#footnote50"><sup class="sml">50</sup></a> says that
such works existed down to his day, and speaks of their great
antiquity. Fortunately a notable example has been preserved in
the acroterium of the gable of the Heraion at Olympia,<a id="footnotetag51" name="footnotetag51"></a>
<a href="#footnote51"><sup class="sml">51</sup></a> a great
disk of clay over seven feet in diameter. It forms a part, says
Dr. Dörpfeld, of the oldest artistic roof construction that has remained
to us from Greek antiquity. That is, the original material
of the acroteria was the same used in the whole covering of the
roof, namely terracotta. The gargoyles also, which later were
always of stone, were originally of terracotta. Further we find
reliefs in terracotta pierced with nail-holes and evidently intended
for the covering of various wooden objects; sometimes, it is safe
to say, for wooden sarcophagi. Here appears clearly the connection
that these works may have had with the later reliefs in marble.</p>

<p>To make now a definite application, it is evident that the connection
between vase-paintings and painted terracottas must from
the nature of the case be a very close one. But when these terracottas
are found to reproduce throughout the exact designs and
figures of vase-paintings, the line between the two fades away.
All the most familiar ornaments of vase technic recur again and
<a name="p32" id="p32"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 32</span>
again, maeanders, palmettes, lotuses, the scale and lattice-work
patterns, the bar-and-tooth ornament, besides spirals of all descriptions.
In exception, also, the parallel is quite as close. In the
great acroterium of the Heraion, for example, the surface was first
covered with a dark varnish-like coating on which the drawing
was incised down to the original clay. Then the outlines were
filled in black, red and white. Here the bearing becomes clear of
an incidental remark of Pausanias in his description of Olympia.
He says (v. 10.): εν δε Ολυμπια (of the Zeus temple) λεβης
επιχρυσος επι 'εκαστω του οροφου τω περατι επικειται. That is
originally aeroteria were only vases set up at the apex and on
the end of the gable. Naturally enough the later terracottas
would keep close to the old tradition.</p>

<p>It is interesting also to find relief-work in terracotta as well as
painting on a plane surface. An example where color and relief
thus unite, which comes from a temple in Caere,<a id="footnotetag52" name="footnotetag52"></a>
<a href="#footnote52"><sup class="sml">52</sup></a> might very well
have been copied from a vase design. It represents a female face
in relief, as occurs so often in Greek pottery, surrounded by an ornament
of lotus, maeander and palmette. Such a raised surface is
far from unusual; and we seem to find here an intermediate stage
between painting and sculpture. The step is indeed a slight one.
A terracotta figurine<a id="footnotetag53" name="footnotetag53"></a>
<a href="#footnote53"><sup class="sml">53</sup></a> from Tarentum helps to make the connection
complete. It is moulded fully in the round, but by way of
adornment, in close agreement with the tradition of vase-painting,
the head is wreathed with rosettes and crowned by a single palmette.
So these smaller covering plates just spoken of, which
were devoted to minor uses, recall continually not only the identical
manner of representation but the identical scenes of vase paintings,--such
favorite subjects, to cite only one example, as the meeting
of Agamemnon's children at his tomb.</p>

<p>From this point of view, it does not seem impossible that pedimental
groups might have fallen under the influence of vase
technic. The whole architectural adornment of the oldest
temple was of pottery. It covered the cornice of the sides, completely
bounded the pedimental space, above and below, and finally
<a name="p33" id="p33"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 33</span>
crowned the whole structure in the acroteria. It would surely
be strange if the pedimental group, framed in this way by vase
designs, were in no way influenced by them. The painted decoration
of these terracottas is that of the bounding friezes in
vase-pictures. The vase-painter employs them to frame and set off the
central scene. Might not the same end have been served by the
terracottas on the temple, with reference to the scene within the
typanum? We must remember, also, that at this early time
the sculptor's art was in its infancy while painting and the
ceramic art had reached a considerable development. Even if all
analogy did not lead the other way, an artist would shrink from
trying to fill up a pediment with statues in the round. The most
natural method was also the easiest for him.</p>

<p>On the question of the original character of the pedimental group,
the Heraion at Olympia, probably the oldest Greek columnar structure
known, furnishes important light. Pausanias says nothing
whatever of any pedimental figures. Of course his silence does not
prove that there were none; but with all the finds of acroteria,
terracottas and the like, no trace of any such sculptures was discovered.
The inference seems certain that the pedimental decoration,
if present at all, was either of wood or of terracotta, or was
merely painted on a smooth surface. The weight of authority
inclines to the last view. It is held that, if artists had become
accustomed to carving pedimental groups in wood, the first examples
that we have in stone would not show so great inability to
deal with the conditions of pedimental composition. If ever the
tympanum was simply painted or filled with a group in terracotta,
it is easy to see why the fashion died and why consequently we can
bring forward no direct proof to-day. It was simply that only
figures in the round can satisfy the requirements of a pedimental
composition. The strong shadows thrown by the cornice, the distance
from the spectator, and the height, must combine to confuse
the lines of a scene painted on a plane surface, or even of a low
relief. So soon as this was discovered and so soon as the art of
sculpture found itself able to supply the want, a new period in
pedimental decoration began.</p>

<p>Literary evidence to support this theory of the origin of pediment
sculpture is not lacking. Pliny says in his Natural History
<a name="p34" id="p34"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 34</span>
(xxxv. 156.): <i>Laudat</i> (Varro) <i>et Pasitelen qui plasticen matrem caelaturæ
et statuariæ sculpturaeque dixit et cum esset in omnibus his summus
nihil unquam fecit antequam finxit</i>. Also (xxxiv. 35.): <i>Similitudines
exprimendi quae prima fuerit origo, in ea quam plasticen Graeci vocant
dici convenientius erit, etenim prior quam statuaria fuit</i>. In both these
cases the meaning of "plasticen" is clearly working, that is, moulding,
in clay. Pliny, again (xxxv. 152.), tells us of the Corinthian
Butades: <i>Butadis inventum est rubricam addere aut ex rubra creta
fingere, primusque personas tegularum extremis imbricibus inposuit,
quae inter initia prostypa vocavit, postea idem ectypa fecit. hinc et
fastigia templorum orta</i>. The phrase <i>hinc et fastigia templorum orla</i>,
has been bracketed by some editors because they could not believe
the fact which it stated. <i>Fastigia</i> may from the whole connection
and the Latin mean "pediments." This is quite in accord with
the famous passage in Pindar,<a id="footnotetag54" name="footnotetag54"></a>
<a href="#footnote54"><sup class="sml">54</sup></a> attributing to the Corinthians the
invention of pedimental composition. Here then we have stated
approximately the conclusion which seems at least probable on
other grounds, namely, that the tympanum of the pediment was
originally filled with a group in terracotta, beyond doubt painted
and in low relief.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote54"

(return) </a> <i>Olymp.</i>, XIII, 21.</blockquote>

<p>But if we assume that the pedimental group could have originated
in this way, we must be prepared to explain the course of
its development up to the pediments of Aegina and the Parthenon,
in which we find an entirely different principle, namely, the filling
of these tympana with figures in the round. It is maintained by
some scholars, notably by Koepp,<a id="footnotetag55" name="footnotetag55"></a>
<a href="#footnote55"><sup class="sml">55</sup></a> that no connection can be
established between high relief and low relief, much less between
statues entirely in the round and low relief. High relief follows
all the principles of sculpture, while low relief may almost be considered
as a branch of the painter's art. But this view seems
opposed to the evidence of the facts. For there still exists a
continuous series of pedimental groups, first in low relief then in
high relief, and finally standing altogether free from the background,
and becoming sculpture in the round. Examples in low
relief are the Hydra pediment from the Acropolis and the pediment
of the Megarian Treasury at Olympia, which, on artistic
<a name="p35" id="p35"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 35</span>
grounds, can be set down as the two earliest now in existence. Then
follow, in order of time and development, the Triton and Typhon
pediments, in high relief, from the Acropolis; and after these the
idea of relief is lost, and the pediment becomes merely a space
destined to be adorned with statuary. Can we reasonably believe
that the Hydra and Triton pediments, standing side by side on the
Acropolis, so close to each other in time and in technic, owe their
origin to entirely different motives, merely for the reason that the
figures of one stand further out from the background than those
of the other? Is it not easier to suppose that the higher reliefs,
as they follow the older low reliefs in time, are developed from
them, than to assume that just at the dividing-line a new principle
came into operation?</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote55"
name="footnote55"></a><b>Footnote 55:</b><a href="#footnotetag55">
(return) </a> <i>Jahrbuch deutschen archäol. Instituts</i>, II, 118.</blockquote>

<p>It is a commonplace to say that sculpture in relief is only one
branch of painting. Conze<a id="footnotetag56" name="footnotetag56"></a>
<a href="#footnote56"><sup class="sml">56</sup></a> publishes a sepulchral monument
which seems to him to mark the first stage of growth. The
surface of the figure and that of the surrounding ground
remain the same; they are separated only by a shallow incised
line. Conze says of it; "The tracing of the outline is no more
than, and is in fact exactly the same as, the tracing employed
by the Greek vase-painter when he outlined his figure with a
brush full of black paint before he filled in with black the
ground about it." The next step naturally is to cut away the
surface outside and beyond the figures; the representation is still
a picture except in the clearer marking of the bounding-line.
The entire further growth and development of the Greek relief is
in the direction of rounding these lines and of detaching the relief
more and more from the back surface. This primitive picturesque
method of treatment is found as well in high relief as in low.
How then can the process of development be different for the
two? I quote from Friedrichs-Wolters<a id="footnotetag57" name="footnotetag57"></a>
<a href="#footnote57"><sup class="sml">57</sup></a> on the metopes of the
temple of Apollon at Selinous, which are distinctly in high relief:
"The relief of these works stands very near to the origin of relief-style.
The surface of the figures is kept flat throughout, although
the effort to represent them in their full roundness is not to be
<a name="p36" id="p36"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 36</span>
mistaken. Only later were relief-figures rounded on the front
and sides after the manner of free figures. Originally, whether
in high or in low relief, they were flat forms, modelled for the
plane surface whose ornament they were to be." As the sculptured
works were brought out further and further from the background,
this background tended to disappear. It was no longer a distinctly
marked surface on which the figures were projected, but now
higher and now lower, serving only to hold the figures together.
When this point was reached, the entire separation of the figures
from one another and from the background, became easy. That is,
the change in conception is an easy step by which the relief was
lost and free-standing figures substituted. This process of change
was especially rapid in pedimental groups, for the reason stated
above. The pediment field from its architectonic conditions was
never suited to decoration in relief. But we find from the works
before us that such a system was at least attempted, that painting
and an increased projection of relief were employed as aids. We are
bound to seek a logical explanation of the facts and of their bearing
on the later history of art, and it is safer to assume a process
of regular development than a series of anomalous changes. Koepp
(<i>cf. supra</i>), for example, assumes that these two pediments in low
relief are simply exceptions to the general rule, accounting for
them by the fact that it was difficult to work out high reliefs from
the poros stone of which they were made. He seems to forget
that the higher reliefs from the Acropolis are of the same poros.
This material in fact appears to have been chosen by the artist
because it was almost as easy to incise and carve as the wood and
clay to which he had been accustomed. The monuments of later
Greek art give no hint of a distinction to be drawn between high
and low relief. We find on the same stele figures barely attached
to the ground, and others in mere outline. If then there are reasons
for finding the origin of pedimental decoration in a plane or low-relief
composition of terracotta, made more effective both by a
framing of like material and technic, and by the acroteria at either
extremity and above, then the process of development which leads
at length to the pediments at Aegina and the Parthenon becomes
at once easy and natural. We note first the change from terracotta
to a low painted relief in stone, then this relief becomes,
<a name="p37" id="p37"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 37</span>
from the necessities of the case, higher and higher until finally it
gives place to free figures.</p>

<p>If ceramic art really did exert such an influence on temple-sculpture,
we should be able to trace analogies in other lines.
The most interesting is found in the design and execution of
sepulchral monuments. Milchhoefer<a id="footnotetag58" name="footnotetag58"></a>
<a href="#footnote58"><sup class="sml">58</sup></a> is of the opinion that the
tomb was not originally marked by an upright slab with sculptured
figures. He finds what he thinks the oldest representation of
sepulchral ornament in a black-figured vase of the so-called "prothesis"
class.<a id="footnotetag59" name="footnotetag59"></a>
<a href="#footnote59"><sup class="sml">59</sup></a> Here are two women weeping about a sepulchral
mound on which rests an amphora of like form to the one that
bears the scene. He maintains then that such a prothesis vase
was the first sepulchral monument, that this was later replaced by
a vase of the same description in marble, of course on account of
the fragile nature of pottery. For this reason, too, we find no
certain proof of the fact in the old tombs, though Dr. Wolters<a id="footnotetag60" name="footnotetag60"></a>
<a href="#footnote60"><sup class="sml">60</sup></a>
thinks that the discovery of fragments of vases on undisturbed
tombs makes the case a very strong one. The use of such vases or
urns of marble for this purpose became very prevalent. They are
nearly always without ornament, save for a single small group, in
relief or sometimes in color, representing the dead and the bereaved
ones. A very evident connecting-link between these urns
and the later sepulchral stele appears in monuments which show
just such urns projected in relief upon a plane surface. The relief is
sometimes bounded by the outlines of the urn itself,<a id="footnotetag61" name="footnotetag61"></a>
<a href="#footnote61"><sup class="sml">61</sup></a> sometimes a
surrounding background is indicated. In many cases this background
assumes the form of the ordinary sepulchral stele. The
Central Museum at Athens is especially rich in examples of this
kind. On two steles which I have noticed there, three urns are
represented side by side. A still more interesting specimen is
a stone so divided that its lower part is occupied by an urn in
relief, above which is sculptured the usual scene of parting. This
<a name="p38" id="p38"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 38</span>
scene has its normal place as a relief or a drawing in color on the
surface of the urn itself; here, where the step in advance of
choosing the plane stele to bear the relief seems already taken,
the strength of tradition still asserts itself, and a similar group is
repeated on the rounded face of the urn below. The transition to
the more common form of sepulchral monument has now become
easy; but the characteristics which point to its genesis in the
funeral vase are still prominent.</p>

<p>This process of development, so far as can be judged from existing
types, reaches down to the beginning of the fourth century
B.C. Steles of a different class are found, dating from a period
long before this. Instead of a group, they bear only the dead
man in a way to suggest his position, or vocation during life. All
show distinctly a clinging to the technic of ceramic art. Sculptured
steles and others merely painted exist side by side. The best
known of the latter class is the Lyseas stele, in the Central Museum
at Athens. Many more of the same sort have been discovered,
differing from their vase predecessors in material and form, but
keeping to the old principles. The outlines, for example, are first
incised, and then the picture is finished with color. The Aristion
stele may be taken as an example of the second order. Relief
plays here the leading part; but it must still be assisted by painting,
while the resemblance to vase-figures in position, arrangement
of clothing, proportion and profile, remains as close as in the
simply painted stele. An ever present feature, also, is the palmette
acroterium, treated in conventional ceramic style. Loeschke
thinks that the origin of red-figured pottery is to be found in
the dark ground and light coloring of these steles. Whether
the opinion be correct or not, it points to a very close connection
between the two forms of art.</p>

<p>The influence of ceramic decoration spread still further. Large
numbers of steles and bases for votive offerings have been discovered
on the Acropolis, which alike repeat over and over again
conventional vase-patterns, and show the use of incised lines and
other peculiarities of the technic of pottery.<a id="footnotetag62" name="footnotetag62"></a>

<p>As to specific resemblances between the pediments of the Acropolis
and vase-pictures, the subjects of all the groups are such
<a name="p39" id="p39"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 39</span>
as appear very frequently on vases of all periods. About seventy
Attic vases are known which deal with the contest of Herakles
and Triton. One of these is a hydria at present in the Berlin
Museum, No. 1906.<a id="footnotetag63" name="footnotetag63"></a>
<a href="#footnote63"><sup class="sml">63</sup></a> Herakles is represented astride the Triton,
and he clasps him with both arms as in the Acropolis group.
The Triton's scaly length, his fins and tail, are drawn in quite the
same way. It is very noticeable that on the vase the contortions
of the Triton's body seem much more violent; here the sculptor
could not well follow the vase-painter so closely. It was far easier
for him to work out the figure in milder curves; but he followed
the vase-type as closely as possible. On the other hand, if the
potter had copied the pedimental group the copy could perfectly
well have been an exact one. The group is very similar also to a
scene in the Assos frieze, with regard to which I quote from
Friedrichs-Wolters;<a id="footnotetag64" name="footnotetag64"></a>
<a href="#footnote64"><sup class="sml">64</sup></a> "It corresponds to the oldest Greek vase-paintings,
in which we find beast fights borrowed from Oriental
art, united with Greek myths and represented after the Greek
manner." This frieze is ascribed to the sixth century B.C., and is
not much later than our pediments.</p>

<p>For the Hydra pediment, there exists a still closer parallel, in
an archaic Corinthian amphora, published by Gerhard.<a id="footnotetag65" name="footnotetag65"></a>
<a href="#footnote65"><sup class="sml">65</sup></a> Athena
appears here as a spectator, though she has no part in the pedimental
group; but in every other point, in the drawing of the
Hydra, of Herakles and Iolaos, the identity is almost complete.
Athena seems to have been omitted, because the artist found it
difficult to introduce another figure in the narrow space. Evidently
the vase must have represented a type known to the sculptor
and copied by him.</p>

Naples, No. 3419, is a black-figured amphora which repeats the same scene. The
drawing and position of the two contestants is just as on the Berlin vase, the Triton
seeking with one hand to break Herakles' hold about his neck, while with the other
he holds a fish as attribute. Athena stands close by, watching the struggle.</blockquote>

<p>For the Typhon pediment, no such close analogies are possible,
at least in the form and arrangement of figures. It would seem
that this is so simply because no vase-picture of this subject that
<a name="p40" id="p40"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 40</span>
we know so far answers the conditions of a pedimental group
that it could be used as a pattern. In matters of detail, a hydria
in Munich, No. 125,<a id="footnotetag66" name="footnotetag66"></a>
<a href="#footnote66"><sup class="sml">66</sup></a> offers the best illustration. For example,
the vase-painting and the relief show quite the same treatment of
hair, beard and wings in the figure of Typhon.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote66"
name="footnote66"></a><b>Footnote 66:</b><a href="#footnotetag66">
(return) </a> <i>Ibid.</i>, No. 287.</blockquote>

<p>Speaking more generally, we find continually in the pediments
reminiscences of ceramic drawing and treatment. The acroteria,
painted in black and red on the natural surface of poros stone,
take the shape of palmettes and lotuses. The cornices above and
below are of clay or poros, painted in just such designs as appear
on the Olympian terracottas; and these designs are frequently
repeated in the sculptures themselves. The feathers of Typhon's
wings are conventionally represented by a scale-pattern; the arc
of the scales has been drawn with compass; we observe still the hole
left in the centre by the leg of the compass. The larger pinions at
the ends of the wings have been outlined, regularly by incised lines,
and then filled up with color. All this is as like the treatment of
vase-figures, as it unlike anything else in plastic art. In the former
the scale-pattern is used conventionally to denote almost anything.
Fragments of vases found on the Acropolis itself picture wings in
just this way; or it may be Athena's aegis, the fleece of a sheep
or the earth's surface that is so represented. On the body of the
Triton and the Echidna of the pediments no attempt is made to
indicate movement and contortion by the position of the scales; it
is everywhere the lifeless conventionality of archaic vase-drawing.
In sculptured representations the scale device is dropped, and with
it the rigid regularity in the ordering of the pinions. Further, in
drawing the scales of the Triton, the artist has dropped usual
patterns and copied exactly a so-called bar-ornament which decorates
the cornice just over the pediment. Here again he chooses
one of the most common motives on vases. For the body of the
Echidna, on the other hand, it is the so-called lattice-work pattern
which represents the scale covering,--a pattern employed in vases
for the most varied purposes, and found on the earliest Cypriote
pottery. Even the roll of the snake-bodies of Typhon seems
to follow a conventional spiral which we find on old Rhodian
ware.</p>

<a name="p41" id="p41"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 41</span>

<p>The outlining and coloring of the figures is most interesting.
The poros stone of the reliefs is so soft that it could easily be
worked with a knife; so incised lines are constantly used, and
regular geometrical designs traced. Quite an assortment of colors
is employed: black, white, red, dark brown, apparent green,
and in the Typhon group, blue. It is very noticeable that these
reliefs, unlike the others which in general furnish the closest
analogies, the metopes of the temple at Selinous and the pediment
of the Megarian Treasury at Olympia, have the ground unpainted.
This is distinctly after the manner of the oldest Greek pottery
and of archaic wall paintings. Herein they resemble also another
archaic pedimental relief, found near the old temple of Dionysos
at Athens, and representing just such a procession of satyrs and
mænads as appears so often on vases.</p>

<p>To give a local habitation to the class of pottery which most
nearly influenced the artist of these reliefs, is not easy. Perhaps
it is a reasonable conjecture to make it Kamiros of Rhodes.
Kamiros ware shows just such an admixture of oriental and
geometrical designs as characterizes our pediments. Strange
monsters of all kinds are represented there; while in the reliefs
before us a goodly number of such monsters are translated to
Greek soil.</p>

<a href="#footnote68"><sup class="sml">68</sup></a> and erected, as we know from
the inscription<a id="footnotetag69" name="footnotetag69"></a>
<a href="#footnote69"><sup class="sml">69</sup></a> on the architrave, to commemorate a choragic
victory won by Lysikrates, son of Lysitheides, with a boy-chorus
of the tribe Akamantis, in the archonship of Euainetos (B.C. 335/4),
has long been one of the most familiar of the lesser remains of
ancient Athens. The monument was originally crowned by the
tripod which was the prize of the successful chorus, and it doubtless
was one of many buildings of similar character along the famous
"Street of Tripods."<a id="footnotetag70" name="footnotetag70"></a>
<a href="#footnote70"><sup class="sml">70</sup></a> It is the aim of this paper to show, that the
earliest publications of the sculptured reliefs on this monument
have given a faulty representation of them, owing to the transposition
of two sets of figures; that this mistake has been repeated
in most subsequent publications down to our day; that inferences
deduced therefrom have in so far been vitiated; and that new
instructive facts concerning Greek composition in sculpture can
be derived from a corrected rendering of the original.</p>

<p>Although we are not now concerned either with the subsequent
fortunes of the monument arid the story of its preservation, or
with its architectural features and the various attempts which
<a name="p43" id="p43"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 43</span>
have been made to restore the original design, it may be convenient
to recall briefly a few of the more important facts pertaining
to these questions. The Monument of Lysikrates first
became an object of antiquarian interest in 1669, when it was
purchased by the Capuchin monks, whose mission had succeeded
that of the Jesuits in 1658, and it was partially enclosed in their
<i>hospitium</i>.<a id="footnotetag71" name="footnotetag71"></a>
<a href="#footnote71"><sup class="sml">71</sup></a> The first attempt to explain its purpose and meaning
was made by a Prussian soldier, Johann Georg Transfeldt, who,
after escaping from slavery in the latter part of 1674, fled to
Athens, where he lived for more than a year.<a id="footnotetag72" name="footnotetag72"></a>
<a href="#footnote72"><sup class="sml">72</sup></a> Transfeldt deciphered
the inscription, but was unable to decide whether the
building was a "<i>templum Demosthenis</i>" or a "<i>Gymnasium a Lysicrate
* * * exstructum propter juventutem Atheniensem ex tribu Acamantia</i>."<a id="footnotetag73" name="footnotetag73"></a>
<a href="#footnote73"><sup class="sml">73</sup></a>
Much more important for the interpretation of the
monument was the visit of Dr. Jacob Spon of Lyons, who arrived
at Athens early in the year 1676. Spon also read the inscription,<a id="footnotetag74" name="footnotetag74"></a>
<a href="#footnote74"><sup class="sml">74</sup></a>
and, from a comparison with other similar inscriptions, determined
the true purpose of edifices of this class.<a id="footnotetag75" name="footnotetag75"></a>
<a href="#footnote75"><sup class="sml">75</sup></a> Finally the first volume
of Stuart and Revett's <i>Antiquities of Athens</i>, which appeared in
1762, confirmed, corrected and extended Spon's results. Careful
and exhaustive drawings accompanied the description of the
monument.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the eighteenth and the early part of the
nineteenth century, Athens was visited by many strangers from
western Europe, and the hospitable convent of the Capuchins and
the enclosed "Lantern," which at this time was used as a closet
for books, acquired some notoriety. Late in the year 1821, however,
during the occupation of Athens by the Turkish troops
under Omer Vrioni, the convent was accidentally burned, and
its most precious treasure was liberated, to be sure, but, as may still
be seen, sadly damaged by the fire, and what was still more
unfortunate, left unprotected and exposed to the destructive mischief
of Athenian street-arabs and their less innocent elders.</p>

<p>Aside from some slight repairs and the clearing away of rubbish,
the monument remained in this condition until 1867, when the
<a name="p44" id="p44"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 44</span>
French Minister at Athens, M. de Gobineau, acting on behalf of
his government, into whose possession the site of the former monastery
had fallen, employed the architect Boulanger to make such
restorations as were necessary to save the monument from falling
to pieces.<a id="footnotetag76" name="footnotetag76"></a>
<a href="#footnote76"><sup class="sml">76</sup></a> At the same time the last remains of the old convent
were removed, and some measures taken to prevent further injury
to the ruin. Repairs were again being made under the direction
of the French School at Athens, when I left Greece, in April, 1892.</p>

<p>For the architectural study of the monument of Lysikrates little
has been done since Stuart's time. In the year 1845 and in 1859,
the architect Theoph. Hansen made a new series of drawings from
the monument, and upon them based a restoration which differs
somewhat from that of Stuart, especially in the decoration of the
roof. This work is discussed in the monograph of Von Lützow.<a id="footnotetag77" name="footnotetag77"></a>
<a href="#footnote77"><sup class="sml">77</sup></a></p>

<p>Confining our attention to the sculptures of the frieze, we will
examine certain inaccuracies of detail which have hitherto prevailed
in the treatment of this important landmark in the history
of decorative reliefs of the fourth century. The frieze, carved in
low relief upon a single block of marble, runs continuously around
the entire circumference of the structure. Its height is only
.012 m. (lower, rectangular moulding) + .23 m. (between mouldings)
+ .015 m. (upper, rounded moulding).<a id="footnotetag78" name="footnotetag78"></a>
<a href="#footnote78"><sup class="sml">78</sup></a> It is to be noticed
that the figures rest upon the lower moulding, while they are
often (in fourteen cases) carried to the top of the upper moulding.</p>

<p>The question as to the subject of the relief was a sore puzzle to
the early travellers. Père Babin finds "<i>des dieux marins</i>";<a id="footnotetag79" name="footnotetag79"></a>
<a href="#footnote79"><sup class="sml">79</sup></a> Transfeldt,
"<i>varias gymnasticorum figuras</i>," which he thought represented
certain games held "<i>in Aegena insula</i>" in honor of Demosthenes.<a id="footnotetag80" name="footnotetag80"></a>
<a href="#footnote80"><sup class="sml">80</sup></a>
Vernon (1676), who regarded the monument as a temple of Hercules,
sees his labors depicted in the sculptures of the frieze.<a id="footnotetag81" name="footnotetag81"></a>
<a href="#footnote81"><sup class="sml">51</sup></a>
Spon, while not accepting this view, admitted that some, at
least, of the acts of Herakles were represented; so that the building,
apart from its monumental purpose, might also have been sacred
<a name="p45" id="p45"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 45</span>
to that deity.<a id="footnotetag82" name="footnotetag82"></a>
<a href="#footnote82"><sup class="sml">82</sup></a> To Stuart and Revett<a id="footnotetag83" name="footnotetag83"></a>
<a href="#footnote83"><sup class="sml">83</sup></a> is due the credit of being
the first to recognize in these reliefs the story of Dionysos and
the pirates, which is told first in the Homeric Hymn to Dionysos.
In the Homeric version, Dionysos, in the guise of a fair youth
with dark locks and purple mantle, appears by the seashore, when
he is espied by Tyrrhenian pirates, who seize him and hale him on
board their ship, hoping to obtain a rich ransom. But when they
proceed to bind him the fetters fall from his limbs, whereupon the
pilot, recognizing his divinity, vainly endeavors to dissuade his
comrades from their purpose. Soon the ship flows with wine;
then a vine with hanging clusters stretches along the sail-top, and
the mast is entwined with ivy. Too late the marauders perceive
their error and try to head for the shore; but straightway the god
assumes the form of a lion and drives them, all save the pious
pilot, terror-stricken into the sea, where they become dolphins.</p>

<p>In the principal post-Homeric versions, the Tyrrhenians endeavor
to kidnap Dionysos under pretext of conveying him to Naxos, the
circumstances being variously related. Thus in the Ναξίακά of
Aglaosthenes (<i>apud</i> HYGIN. Poet. Astronom. II. 17), the child
Dionysos and his companions are to be taken to the nymphs, his
nurses. According to Ovid,<a id="footnotetag84" name="footnotetag84"></a>
<a href="#footnote84"><sup class="sml">84</sup></a> the pirates find the god on the shore
of Chios, stupid with sleep and wine, and bring him on board
their vessel. On awaking he desires to be conveyed to Naxos,
but the pirates turn to the left, whereupon, as they give no heed to
his remonstrances, they are changed to dolphins and leap into the
sea. Similarly Servius, <i>Ad. Verg. Aen.</i>, I. 67. In the <i>Fabulæ</i> of
Hyginus (CXXXIV), and in Pseudo-Apollodorus,<a id="footnotetag85" name="footnotetag85"></a>
<a href="#footnote85"><sup class="sml">85</sup></a> Dionysos engages
passage with the Tyrrhenians. Nonnus, however, returns to the
Homeric story, which he has modified, extended, and embellished
in his own peculiar way.<a id="footnotetag86" name="footnotetag86"></a>
<a href="#footnote86"><sup class="sml">86</sup></a> These versions, to which may be added
that of Seneca,<a id="footnotetag87" name="footnotetag87"></a>
<a href="#footnote87"><sup class="sml">87</sup></a> all agree in making the scene take place on shipboard,
and, if we except the "comites" of Aglaosthenes, in none of
them is the god accompanied by a retinue of satyrs. But Philostratus<a id="footnotetag88" name="footnotetag88"></a>
<a href="#footnote88"><sup class="sml">88</sup></a>
pretends to describe a painting, in which two ships are
<a name="p46" id="p46"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 46</span>
portrayed, the pirate-craft lying in ambush for the other, which
bears Dionysos and his rout.</p>

<p>In our frieze, however, the myth is represented in an entirely
different manner. The scene is not laid on shipboard, but near
the shore of the sea, where, as the action shows, Dionysos and his
attendant satyrs are enjoying the contents of two large craters,
when they are attacked by pirates. The satyrs who are characterized
as such by their tails, and in most cases (9 + 2:7) by the
panther-skin, forthwith take summary vengeance upon their
assailants, of whom some are bound, others beaten and burned,
while others take refuge in the sea, only to be changed into dolphins
by the invisible power of the god.</p>

<p>These modifications of the traditional form of the story have
usually<a id="footnotetag89" name="footnotetag89"></a>
<a href="#footnote89"><sup class="sml">89</sup></a> been accounted for by the necessities of plastic art; and
this view has in its favor that the representation in sculpture of
any of the other versions which are known to us, would be
attended by great difficulties of composition, and would certainly
be much less effective. Reisch, however, has suggested<a id="footnotetag90" name="footnotetag90"></a>
<a href="#footnote90"><sup class="sml">90</sup></a> that this
frieze illustrates the dithyrambus which won the prize on this
occasion, and that the variations in the details of the story are due
to this. There is no evidence for this hypothesis, inasmuch as
we have no basis upon which to found an analogy, and know
nothing whatever of the nature of the piece in which the chorus
had figured.</p>

<p>The general arrangement and technic of this relief, the skill
with which unity of design is preserved despite the circular form,
the energy of the action, and the variety of the grouping, have
often been pointed out. More particularly, the harmony and
symmetry, which the composition exhibits, have been noticed by
most of the later writers who have had occasion to describe the
frieze. It is here, however, that we find the divergencies and
inaccuracies which have been alluded to above, and these are such
as to merit a closer examination.</p>

<p>To begin with the central scene, which is characterized as such
by the symmetrical grouping of two pairs of satyrs about the god
<a name="p47" id="p47"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 47</span>
Dionysos and his panther and is externally defined by a crater at
either side, we observe that, while the two satyrs immediately to
the right (I¹) and left (I) of Dionysos (0), correspond in youth and
in their attitude toward him, the satyr at the left (I) has a thyrsus
and a mantle which the other does not possess. These figures
have unfortunately suffered much; the central group is throughout
badly damaged, the upper part of the body and the head of
Dionysos especially so. Of the tail of the panther as drawn in
Stuart's work, no trace exists. The faces of the two satyrs and
the head of the thyrsus are also much mutilated. The other two
satyrs (II:II¹), whose faces are also mutilated, correspond very
closely in youth, action, and nudity. In these two pairs of figures
it is also to be noticed that the heads of I and II at the left face
the central group, while the heads of I¹ and II¹ at the right are
turned away from the centre, toward the right. By this device
the sculptor has obviated any awkwardness which might arise
from the necessity of placing Dionysos in profile.</p>

<p>Passing now to the scenes outside of the vases, we observe that,
of the first pair of satyrs, the bearded figure at the left (III), leans
upon a tree-stump, over which is thrown his panther-skin, as he
contemplates the contest between his fellows and the pirates,
while against his right side rests a thyrsus. The corresponding
satyr on the right (III¹), also bearded, but with his head now nearly
effaced, wears his mantle slung over the left shoulder as he advances
to the right, offering with his right hand the freshly filled
wine-cup to a youthful companion (IV¹). The latter, with panther-skin
over left shoulder and arm, and club (partially effaced) in
outstretched right hand, is moving rapidly to the right, as if to
join in the battle; his face (also somewhat mutilated) is partly
turned to the left, and despite his attitude of refusal he forms a
sort of group with his neighbor on that side (III¹), and has no connection,
as has been wrongly assumed,<a id="footnotetag91" name="footnotetag91"></a>
<a href="#footnote91"><sup class="sml">91</sup></a> with the following group
to the right (V¹). Corresponding with this youthful satyr, we have
on the left (IV) a nude bearded satyr (face somewhat damaged,)
armed with a torch instead of a club, moving swiftly to the left
to take part in the contest. He has no group-relation with his
<a name="p48" id="p48"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 48</span>
neighbor on the right (III), although he maybe supposed to have
just left him. The relation is not sufficiently marked in the case
of the corresponding figures on the other side (III¹, IV¹) to injure the
symmetry.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote91"
name="footnote91"></a><b>Footnote 91:</b><a href="#footnotetag91">
(return) </a> <i>British Museum Marbles,</i> IX, p. 114.</blockquote>

<p>These two pairs of satyrs serve to express the transition from
the untroubled ease of Dionysos and his immediate attendants, to
the violence and confusion of the struggle. Thus the first pair
(III:III¹) seem to feel that their active participation is unnecessary,
and so belong rather to the central scene;   while the second
pair (iv:iv¹), hurrying to the combat, are to be reckoned rather
with those who are actively engaged.    This is also emphasized by
the symmetrical alternation of young and old satyrs, <i>i.e.</i>:</p>

<pre>
                 old   young   old   young   old   young
                 VIa    Vb      IV    IV¹    V¹b   VI¹b
</pre>

<p>and by their correspondence to VII:VII¹.</p>

<p>On the left side we have next a group, turned toward the right,
consisting of a young satyr with flowing panther-skin (Vb), who
places his left knee on the back of a prostrate pirate (Va) whom
he is about to strike with a club which he holds in his uplifted
right hand. The pirate (face now somewhat damaged) is, like all
of his fellows, youthful and nude. The corresponding group on
the right, faces the left, and represents a nude bearded satyr (V¹,)
with left knee on the hip of a fallen pirate (V¹a), whose hands he
is about to bind behind his back. Thus the arrangement of the
two groups corresponds, but the action is somewhat different.</p>

<p>I now wish to point out an error which is interesting and
instructive as illustrating how mistakes creep into standard archæological
literature to the detriment of a proper appreciation of
the original monuments; and I may perhaps hope not only to
correct this error once for all, but also, in so doing, to make
clearer certain noteworthy artistic qualities of this composition.</p>

<p>If we turn to the reproductions of the Lysikrates frieze in the
common manuals of Greek sculpture, we find that the group (V¹)
has exchanged places with the next group to the right (VI¹) while
the corresponding groups on the left side (V, VI) retain their proper
position. In order to detect the source of this confusion, we have
only to examine the drawings of Stuart and Revett, from which
nearly all the subsequent illustrations are more or less directly
<a name="p49" id="p49"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 49</span>
derived. In the first volume of Stuart and Revett, the groups
(V¹, IV¹) occupy plates XIII and XIV, and it is evident that the drawings
have been in some way misplaced. These plates have been
reproduced on a reduced scale in Meyer's <i>Gesch. d. bildenden
Künste<a id="footnotetag92" name="footnotetag92"></a>
<a href="#footnote92"><sup class="sml">92</sup></a></i> (1825); Müller-Wieseler<a id="footnotetag93" name="footnotetag93"></a>
<a href="#footnote93"><sup class="sml">93</sup></a> (1854); Overbeck,<a id="footnotetag94" name="footnotetag94"></a>
<a href="#footnote94"><sup class="sml">94</sup></a> <i>Plastik³</i>
(1882); W.C. Perry, <i>History of Greek Sculpture<a id="footnotetag95" name="footnotetag95"></a>
<a href="#footnote95"><sup class="sml">95</sup></a></i> (1882); Mrs. L.M.

<a href="#footnote98"><sup class="sml">98</sup></a></i> (1890), and in all
with the same misarrangement.</p>

<p>Nevertheless correct reproductions of the frieze, derived from
other sources, have not been wholly lacking. There is, for example,
a drawing of the whole monument by S. Pomardi in Dodwell's
<i>Tour through Greece<a id="footnotetag99" name="footnotetag99"></a>
<a href="#footnote99"><sup class="sml">99</sup></a></i> (1819), in which the correct position of these
groups is clearly indicated. In 1842 appeared volume IX of the
<i>British Museum Marbles</i> containing engravings of a cast made by
direction of Lord Elgin, about 1800.<a id="footnotetag100" name="footnotetag100"></a>
<a href="#footnote100"><sup class="sml">100</sup></a> Inasmuch as this cast or
similar copies have always been the chief sources for the study of
the relief, owing to the unsatisfactory preservation of the original,
it is the more strange that this mistake should have remained so
long uncorrected,<a id="footnotetag101" name="footnotetag101"></a>
<a href="#footnote101"><sup class="sml">101</sup></a> or that Müller-Wieseler should imply<a id="footnotetag102" name="footnotetag102"></a>
<a href="#footnote102"><sup class="sml">102</sup></a> that
their engraving was corrected from the British Museum publication,
when no trace of such correction is to be found. A third
drawing in which the true arrangement is shown, is the engraving
after Hansen's restoration of the whole monument, published in
Von Lützow's monograph<a id="footnotetag103" name="footnotetag103"></a>
<a href="#footnote103"><sup class="sml">103</sup></a> (1868). Although Stuart's arrangement
violates the symmetry maintained between the other groups
of the frieze, yet Overbeck<a id="footnotetag104" name="footnotetag104"></a>
<a href="#footnote104"><sup class="sml">104</sup></a> especially commends the symmetry
shown in the composition of these portions of the relief.</p>

<p>Now let us examine the symmetry as manifested in the corrected
arrangement. After the figures which we have found to have a
thoroughly symmetrical disposition, we have on the left side a
group consisting of a bearded satyr (face damaged), with panther-skin
(VI a), about to strike with his thyrsus a pirate kneeling at the
left (VI b), with his hands bound behind his back. The face of this
figure is also somewhat injured. The corresponding group on
the right (VI¹ instead of the erroneous V¹), represents a youthful
satyr with panther-skin thrown over his arm (VI¹ a), about to strike
with the club which he holds in his uplifted right hand, a pirate
(VI¹ b), who has been thrown on his back, and raises his left arm,
partly in supplication and partly to ward off the blow. As in
the groups V:V¹, so in VI:VI¹, persons, action, and arrangement,
are closely symmetrical, while a graceful variety and harmony is
effected by so modifying each of these elements as to repeat scarcely
a detail in the several corresponding figures.</p>

<p>After these five fighters, we observe on the left a powerful
bearded satyr (face much injured), with flowing panther-skin, facing
the right, and wrenching away a branch from a tree (VII). The
corresponding figure on the right side (VII¹) is a nude, bearded satyr,
who is breaking down a branch of a tree. At first the correspondence
does not seem to be maintained, for this satyr faces the right,
whereas after the analogy of figures VII and IV we might expect him
to face the left. But a closer examination shows that this lack of
symmetry is apparent only when figures VII:VII¹ are considered
individually, and apart from the scenes to which they belong.
For while IV and VII, the outside figures of the main scene on the
left, appropriately face each other, the figures IV¹ and VII¹, which
occupy the same position with regard to the chief scene on the
right, are placed so as to face in opposite directions. By this
subtle device, for which the relation between the figures III¹ and IV¹
furnishes an evident motive, the sculptor has contrived to indicate
distinctly the limits of these scenes, while the symmetry existing
between them is heightened and emphasized by the avoidance
of rigid uniformity.</p>

<p>The trees serve also to mark the end of the preceding scenes,
and to contrast the land, upon which they stand, with the sea, of
which we behold a portion on either side, while a pair of corresponding,
<a name="p51" id="p51"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 51</span>
semi-human dolphins (VIII : VIII¹) are just leaping into
the element which is to form their home. These dolphins are not
quite accurately drawn in Stuart and Revett, for what appears as
an under jaw is, as Dodwell<a id="footnotetag105" name="footnotetag105"></a>
<a href="#footnote105"><sup class="sml">105</sup></a> rightly pointed out, a fin, and their
mouths are closed; the teeth, which are seen in Stuart's drawing
and all subsequent reproductions of it, do not exist on the monument.
The correct form of the head may be seen in the British
Museum publication.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote105"
name="footnote105"></a><b>Footnote 105:</b><a href="#footnotetag105">
(return) </a> I, p. 290.</blockquote>

<p>After these dolphins, we have on each side another piece of
land succeeded again by a stretch of sea. On these pieces of land
are seen on each side two groups of two figures each, while a
third incipient dolphin (0¹), which does not stand in group-relation
with any of the other figures, leaps into the sea between them. In
these groups there is a general correspondence, but it does not
extend to particular positions or to accessories.</p>

<p>At the left we observe first a bearded satyr with torch and flowing
panther-skin (IX a), pursuing a pirate, who flees to the left (IX b).
The space between the satyr and his victim is in part occupied by
a hole, which was probably cut for a beam at the time when the
monument was built into the convent. In the corresponding
places on the right side, we have a bearded satyr with panther-skin
(IX¹ a), about to strike with the forked club which he holds in
his uplifted right hand, a seated and bound pirate (IX¹ b), whose
hair the satyr has clutched with his left hand. The heads of both
figures are considerably damaged, and the lower part of the right
leg of the pirate is quite effaced. To return to the left side, the
tree at the left of the fleeing pirate (IX b), does not correspond with
any thing on the right side. It serves to indicate the shore of the
sea, while on the other side this is effected by the high rocks upon
which the pirate (X¹ b) is seated.</p>

<p>The next group on the left is represented as at the very edge of
the water, and consists of a nude bearded satyr (X b), who is
dragging an overthrown pirate (X a) by the foot, with the evident
intention of hurling him into the sea. The legs and the right arm
of this pirate have been destroyed by another hole, similar to that
which is found between figures IX and IX a. On the right side, a
<a name="p52" id="p52"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 52</span>
bearded satyr, with flowing panther-skin (x¹ a) rushes to the right,
thrusting a torch into the face of a pirate who is seated on a rock
(x¹ b), with his hands bound behind his back. In his shoulder
are fastened the fangs of a serpent, which is in keeping here as
sacred to Dionysos. Perhaps, as Stuart has suggested,<a id="footnotetag106" name="footnotetag106"></a>
<a href="#footnote106"><sup class="sml">106</sup></a> he may
be a metamorphosis of the cord with which the pirate's hands are
bound; but the sculptor has not made this clear. The figures of
this group, which were in tolerable preservation at the time when
Lord Elgin's cast was made, have since been nearly effaced, particularly
the face, legs and torch of the satyr, and the face and legs of
the pirate, also the rocks upon which he is seated, and the serpent.
Between these figures and the following dolphin, there is a third
hole, similar to those mentioned already, and measuring 15x16
centimetres.</p>

in the British Mus.</i> IX. p. 115.</blockquote>

<p>The less rigid correspondence of these groups (x, ix : ix¹, x¹),
has caused some difficulty. In the text of the <i>British Museum
Marbles</i><a id="footnotetag107" name="footnotetag107"></a>
<a href="#footnote107"><sup class="sml">107</sup></a>, all that falls between the pair of dolphins (VII : VIII¹), is
regarded as belonging to a separate composition, grouped about
the single dolphin (0¹). But such an interpolated composition,
besides having no purpose in itself, would vitiate the unity of the
entire relief. For, although the circular form is less favorable to
a strongly marked symmetry than is the plane, at least in compositions
of small extent, still the individual figures and groups
must bear some relation to a common centre, and there can be no
division of interest, or mere stringing together of disconnected
figures or groups of figures. Such a stringing together is assumed
by Mr. Murray, when, in his <i>History of Greek Sculpture</i>,<a id="footnotetag108" name="footnotetag108"></a>
<a href="#footnote108"><sup class="sml">108</sup></a> he speaks
of seven figures after the pair of dolphins, which, "though without
direct responsion among themselves, still indicate the continued
punishment of the pirates." In the pirate seated on the rocks
(x b), however, Mr. Murray<a id="footnotetag109" name="footnotetag109"></a>
<a href="#footnote109"><sup class="sml">109</sup></a> finds what he calls a "sort of echo"
of Dionysos, inasmuch as he is seated in a commanding position,
and is attacked by the god's serpent. There is, to be sure, a certain
external resemblance in the attitudes of the two figures, but
direct connection cannot be assumed without separating x¹ a
<a name="p53" id="p53"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 53</span>
from x¹ b, with which, however, it obviously forms a group, and
entirely disregarding the relations which the groups x, ix: ix¹, x¹
bear to one another and to the dolphin 0¹. And this Mr. Murray
does, when he takes seven figures, among which x¹ b is evidently
to be considered as central instead of what is plainly four groups
of two figures each, <i>plus</i> one dolphin.</p>

<p>There is, as we have already said, a general correspondence
between these groups. This is effected, in such a way that the
group ix resembles x¹ in action and arrangement, rather than 9¹,
which, on the other hand, resembles group x, rather than group
ix. In other words, the diagonalism which we have noticed above
in the arrangement of young and old satyrs (vi a, v b, iv : iv¹,
v¹ b, vi¹ a), is extended here to the groups themselves.</p>

<p>Moreover, the stretches of sea with the paired dolphins (viii :
viii¹), which are introduced between these groups and those which
had preceded, are not to be regarded as separating the composition
into two parts, but as connecting the central scene with similar
scenes in a different locality. These scenes are again joined
by another stretch of sea with the single dolphin (0¹), which
thus forms the centre of the back of the relief, opposite Dionysos,
and the terminus of the action which proceeds from the
god toward either side.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say, however, that these scenes beyond the
dolphins (viii: viii¹), are to be looked upon as a mere repetition of
those which have preceded, distinguished only by greater license
in the symmetry, or that the changes of locality have no other
purpose than to lend variety to the action. On the contrary, if we
examine the indications of scenery in this relief, we see that those
features by which the artist has characterized the place of this
part of the action as the seashore, the trees near the water's edge,
the alternating stretches of land and sea, the dolphins, the satyr
pulling the pirate into the water (x), are confined to the space
beyond the trees. In the scenes on the other side of the trees,
there is not only no suggestion of the sea, but the rocks and the
sequence of figures up to Dionysos indicate rather that his place of
repose is some elevation near the seashore. The contrast between
the more peaceful and luxurious surroundings of the god and the
violent contest with the pirates, is thus carried out and enforced
<a name="p54" id="p54"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 54</span>
by the sculptural indications of landscape, as well as by the leading
lines of the composition. Though I would not imply that the
composition of this frieze was in any way governed by the laws
which rule similar compositions in pediments, it is interesting and
instructive to note that the general principles of distribution of
subject which have been followed, are somewhat similar to those
which we can trace in the best-known pediments extant; thus, as
the god in his more elevated position would occupy the centre of
the pediment, so the low-lying seashore and the scenes which are
being enacted upon it correspond to the wings at either side.</p>

<p>To recapitulate, the concordance of figures in this relief is then
briefly as follows: In the central scene, <i>i.e.</i>, inside the vases, and
in the first pair of transitional figures (III, II, I:I¹, II¹, III¹), equality
of persons, but not of accessories (drapery, thyrsi); action symmetrical.
In the immediately adjacent scenes, including the second
pair of transitional figures and the satyrs at the trees (VII, VI, V,
IV:IV¹, V¹, VI¹ , VII¹), the persons are diagonally symmetrical in
VIa, Vb, IV:IV¹, V¹b, VI¹a (<i>i.e.</i>, old, young, old: young, old,
young), equal in VII:VII¹. The drapery is diagonally symmetrical
in Vb, IV:IV¹, V¹b (<i>i.e.</i>, panther-skin, nudity: panther-skin,
nudity), equal in VIa:VI¹a, not symmetrical in VII:VII¹, and the
weapons are not symmetrical, except in VII:VII¹ (<i>i.e.</i>, thyrsus,
club, torch: club, no weapon, club). The action is symmetrical
throughout, although not exactly the same in V:V¹. In the
scenes beyond the dolphins, the persons are equivalent (X, IX:
IX¹, X¹), while the action, drapery and weapons are harmonious,
but not diagonally symmetrical (<i>i.e.</i>, IXa = X¹a, but Xb < IX¹a).
At the left, a tree, at the right, a pile of rocks and a serpent.--The
persons are, accordingly, symmetrical throughout; the action
is so until past the dolphins (VIII:VIII¹); the drapery only in II:
II¹, and in VI, V, IV:IV¹, V¹, VI¹; and the weapons not at all.</p>

<p>It is thus apparent that the correspondence of the figures in
this frieze is by no means rigid and schematic or devoid of life,
but that, on the contrary, the same principles of symmetry obtain
which have been pointed out by many authorities as prevalent
in Greek art.<a id="footnotetag110" name="footnotetag110"></a>
<a href="#footnote110"><sup class="sml">110</sup></a> The whole composition exhibits freedom and
<a name="p55" id="p55"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 55</span>
elasticity, not so indulged in as to produce discord, but peculiarly
appropriate to the element of mirth and comedy which characterizes
the story, and upon which the sculptor has laid especial
stress.</p>

<p>But while the date of the so-called Lenaea has been so long open
to question, until recently it has been universally held that some
portion at least of all the festivals at Athens in honor of the wine-god
was held in the precinct by the extant theatre of Dionysus.
With the ruins of this magnificent structure before the eyes, and
no other theatre in sight, the temptation was certainly a strong
one to find in this neighborhood the Limnae mentioned in the
records of the ancients. When Pervanoglu found a handful of
rushes in the neighborhood of the present military hospital, the
matter seemed finally settled. So, on the maps and charts of
<a name="p57" id="p57"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 57</span>
Athens we find the word <i>Limnae</i> printed across that region lying
to the south of the theatre, beyond the boulevard and the hospital.
When, therefore, <i>Mythology and Monuments of Athens</i>, by Harrison
and Verrall, appeared over a year ago, those familiar with the
topography of Athens as laid down by Curtius and Kaupert were
astonished to find, on the little plan facing page 5, that the Limnae
had been removed from their time-honored position and located
between the Coloneus Agoraeus and the Dipylum. That map
incited the preparation of the present article.</p>

<p>While investigating the reasons for and against so revolutionary
a change, the writer has become convinced that here, Dr. Dörpfeld,
the author of the new view, has built upon a sure foundation.
How much in this paper is due to the direct teaching of Dr.
Dörpfeld in the course of his invaluable lectures <i>An Ort und Stelle</i>
on the topography of Athens, I need not say to those who have
listened to his talks. How much besides he has given to me of
both information and suggestion I would gladly acknowledge
in detail; but as this may not always be possible, I will say now
that the views presented here after several months of study, in the
main correspond with those held by Dr. Dörpfeld. The facts and
authorities here cited, and the reasoning deduced from these, are,
however, nearly all results of independent investigation. So I
shall content myself in general with presenting the reasons which
have led me to my own conclusions; for it would require a volume
to set forth all the arguments of those who hold opposing views.</p>

<p>The passage Thucydides, II. 15, is the authority deemed most
weighty for the placing of the Limnae to the south of the Acropolis.
The question of the location of this section of Athens is
so intimately connected with the whole topography of the ancient
city, that it cannot be treated by itself. I quote therefore the
entire passage:</p>

<p>το δέ προ τουτου η ακρόπολις ή νυν ούσα πόλις ην, καΐ το υπ' αυτήν
προς νότον μάλιστα τετραμμενον. τεκμηριον δε · τα γaρ ιeρa εv αυτη
τη άκροπόλει και άλλων θεών εστί, καΐ τα εζω προς τοuτο το μέρος
της πολεως μάλλον ΐδρυται, το τε του Διός του Όλυμπίου, καϊ το
Πύθιον, καϊ το της Γης, καΐ το εν Αίμναις Διονύσου, ω τα αρχαιότερα
Διονύσια τη δωδέκατη ποιείται eν μηνΐ Άνθεστηριώνι · ώσπερ καΐ οι
απ' 'Αθηναίων Ιωveς ετι καΐ νυν νομιζουσιν. ΐδρυται δε καΐ αλλά ιερα
<a name="p58" id="p58"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 58</span>
ταύτη αρχαια. και τη κρήνη τη νnν μeν των τυράννων ουτω σκευασάυτων
Έννεακρούνω καλουμένη, το δε πάλαι φανερων των πηγων
ούσων Καλλιρρόη ωνομασμένη, εκείνη τε εγγυς ουση τα πλείστου
αξια εχρωντο, και νυν ετι απο του αρχαίου προ τε γαμικων και ες
αλλα των ιερων νομίζεται τω uδατι χρησθαι.</p>

<p>Two assumptions are made from this text by those who place
the Limnae by the extant theatre. The first is that υπ' αυτήν includes
the whole of the extensive section to the south of the
Acropolis extending to the Ilissus, and reaching to the east far
enough to include the existing Olympieum, with the Pythium and
Callirrhoe, which lay near. The second assumption is that these
are the particular localities mentioned under the τεκμήριον δε. Let
us see if this is not stretching υπ' αυτήν a little. I will summarize,
so far as may be necessary for our present purpose, the views of
Dr. Dörpfeld on the land lying υπο την ακρόπολιν, or the Pelasgicum.</p>

<p>That the Pelasgicum was of considerable size is known from
the fact that it was one of the sacred precincts occupied when
the people came crowding in from the country at the beginning
of the Peloponnesian War,<a id="footnotetag117" name="footnotetag117"></a>
<a href="#footnote117"><sup class="sml">117</sup></a> and from the inscription<a id="footnotetag118" name="footnotetag118"></a>
<a href="#footnote118"><sup class="sml">118</sup></a> which
forbade that stone should be quarried in or carried from the precinct,
or that earth should be removed therefrom. That the
Pelasgicum with its nine gates was on the south, west, and southwest
slopes, the formation of the Acropolis rock proves, since it is
only here that the Acropolis can be ascended easily. That it
should include all that position of the hillside between the spring
in the Aesculapieum on the south and the Clepsydra on the northwest,
was necessary; for in the space thus included lay the springs
which formed the source of the water-supply for the fortifications.
That the citadel was divided into two parts, the Acropolis proper,
and the Pelasgicum, we know.<a id="footnotetag119" name="footnotetag119"></a>
<a href="#footnote119"><sup class="sml">119</sup></a> One of the two questions in each
of the two passages from Aristophanes refers to the Acropolis,
and the other to the Pelasgicum, and the two are mentioned as
parts of the citadel. That the Pelasgicum actually did extend
from the Aesculapieum to the Clepsydra we know from Lucian.<a id="footnotetag120" name="footnotetag120"></a>

<p>The people are represented as coming up to the Acropolis in
crowds, filling the road. The way becoming blocked by numbers,
in their eagerness they begin to climb up by ladders, first from
he Pelasgicum itself, through which the road passes. As this
space became filled, they placed their ladders a little further from
the road, in the Aesculapieum to the right and by the Areopagus
to the left. Still others come, and they must move still further
out to find room, to the grave of Talos beyond the Aesculapieum
and to the Anaceum beyond the Areopagus. In another passage
of Lucian,<a id="footnotetag121" name="footnotetag121"></a>
<a href="#footnote121"><sup class="sml">121</sup></a> Hermes declares that Pan dwells just above the Pelasgicum;
so it reached at least as far as Pan's grotto.</p>

<p>The fortifications of Mycenæ and Tiryns prove that it was not
uncommon in ancient Greek cities to divide the Acropolis, the
most ancient city, into an upper and a lower citadel.</p>

<p>Finally, that the strip of hillside in question was in fact the Pelasgicum,
we are assured by the existing foundations of the ancient
walls. A Pelasgic wall extends as a boundary-wall below the
Aesculapieum, then onward at about the same level until interrupted
by the Odeum of Herodes Atticus. At this point there are plain
indications that before the construction of this building, this old
wall extended across the space now occupied by the auditorium.
Higher up the hill behind the Odeum, and both within and without
the Beulé gate, we find traces of still other walls which
separated the terraces of the Pelasgicum and probably contained
the nine gates which characterized it. Here then we have the
ancient city of Cecrops, the city before Theseus, consisting of the
Acropolis and the part close beneath, particularly to the south,
the Pelasgicum. We shall find for other reasons also that there is
no need to stretch the meaning of the words ὑπ αὐτὴν πρὸς νότον
to make them cover territory something like half a mile to the
eastward, and to include the later Olympieum within the limits of
our early city.</p>

<p>Wachsmuth has well said,<a id="footnotetag122" name="footnotetag122"></a>
<a href="#footnote122"><sup class="sml">122</sup></a> although this is not invariably true,<a id="footnotetag123" name="footnotetag123"></a>
<a href="#footnote123"><sup class="sml">123</sup></a>
that υπο την ακρόπολιν and υπο τη ακροπόλει are used with reference
<a name="p60" id="p60"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 60</span>
to objects lying halfway up the slope of the Acropolis. On
the next page he adds, however, that Thucydides could not have
meant to describe as the ancient city simply the ground enclosed
within the Pelasgic fortifications, or he would have mentioned
these in the τεκμήρια. Thucydides, in the passage quoted,
wished to show that the city of Cecrops was very small in comparison
with the later city of Theseus; that the Acropolis was
inhabited; and that the habitations did not extend beyond the
narrow limits of the fortifications. He distinctly says that before
the time of Theseus, the Acropolis was the city. He proceeds to
give the reasons for his view: The presence of the ancient temples
on the Acropolis itself, the fact that the ancient precincts outside
the Acropolis were προς τουτο το μέρος της πολεως, and the neighborhood
of the fountain Enneacrounus. We know, that the Acropolis
was still officially called πολις in Thucydides' day; and πόλις so
used would have no meaning if the Acropolis itself was not the
ancient city. Προς τουτο το μέρος, in the passage quoted, refers to
the city of Cecrops, the Acropolis and Pelasgicum taken together;
and της πολεως refers to the entire later city as it existed in the time
of Thucydides. It is, however, in the four temples outside the
Acropolis included under the τεκμήριον δέ that we are particularly
interested. The Pythium of the passage cannot be that Pythium
close by the present Olympieum, which was founded by Pisistratus.
Pausanias (I. 28, 4,) says: "On the descent [from the Acropolis],
not in the lower part of the city but just below the Propylæa, is a
spring of water, and close by a shrine of Apollo in a cave. It is
believed that here Apollo met Creusa." Probably it was because
this cave was the earliest abode of Apollo in Athens that
Euripides placed here the scene of the meeting of Apollo and
Creusa.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Dörpfeld it was opposite this Pythium that the
Panathenaic ship came to rest.<a id="footnotetag124" name="footnotetag124"></a>
<a href="#footnote124"><sup class="sml">124</sup></a> In <i>Ion</i>, 285, Euripides makes it
clear that, from the wall near the Pythium, the watchers looked
toward Harma for that lightning which was the signal for the
sending of the offering to Delphi. This passage would have no
meaning if referred to lightning to be seen by looking toward
<a name="p61" id="p61"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 61</span>
Harma from any position near the existing Olympieum; for the
rocks referred to by Euripides are to the northwest, and so could
not be visible from the later Pythium. To be sure, in later times
the official title of the Apollo of the cave seems to have been υπ'
ακραίω or εν ακραις, but this was only after such a distinction
became necessary from the increased number of Apollo precincts
in the city. The inscriptions referring to the cave in this manner
are without exception of Roman date.<a id="footnotetag125" name="footnotetag125"></a>
<a href="#footnote125"><sup class="sml">125</sup></a> From Strabo we learn<a id="footnotetag126" name="footnotetag126"></a>
<a href="#footnote126"><sup class="sml">126</sup></a>
that the watch looked "toward Harma" from an altar to Zeus
Astrapæus on the wall between the Pythium and the Olympieum.
This wall has always been a source of trouble to those who place
the Pythium in question near the present Olympieum. But this
difficulty vanishes if we accept the authority of Euripides, for the
altar of Zeus Astrapæus becomes located on the northwest wall
of the Acropolis; and from this lofty position above the Pythium,
with an unobstructed view of the whole northern horizon, it is
most natural to expect to see these flashes from Harma.</p>

<p>The Olympieum mentioned by Strabo and Thucydides cannot
therefore be the famous structure begun by Pisistratus and dedicated
by Hadrian: we must look for another on the northwest
side of the Acropolis. Here, it must be admitted we could wish for
fuller evidence. Pausanias (I. 18. 8) informs us that "they say
Deucalion built the old sanctuary of Zeus Olympius." Unfortunately
he does not say where it was located.</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose in an interesting paper read before the British
School at Athens in the spring of 1891, setting forth the results
of his latest investigations at the Olympieum, said that in the
course of his investigations there appeared foundations which he
could ascribe to no other building than this most ancient temple.
But Dr. Dörpfeld, after a careful examination of these remains,
declares that they could by no possibility belong to the sanctuary
of the legendary Deucalion.<a id="footnotetag127" name="footnotetag127"></a>
<a href="#footnote127"><sup class="sml">127</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote127"

(return) </a> It has been held that Pausanias mentions the tomb of Deucalion, which was
near the existing Olympieum, as a proof that Deucalion's temple was also here.
Pausanias however merely says in this passage that this tomb was pointed out in his
day only as a proof that Deucalion sojourned at Athens.</blockquote>

<a name="p62" id="p62"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 62</span>

<p>The abandonment of work on the great temple of the Olympian
Zeus from the time of the Pisistratids to that of Antiochus Epiphanes,
would have left the Athenians without a temple of Zeus
for 400 years, unless there existed elsewhere a foundation in his
honor. It is on its face improbable that the citizens would have
allowed so long a time to pass unless they already possessed some
shrine to which they attached the worship and festivals of the chief
of the gods.</p>

<p>The spade has taught us that the literary record of old sanctuaries
is far from being complete. The new cutting for the Piræus
railroad has brought to light inscriptions referring to a hitherto
unknown precinct in the Ceramicus.</p>

<p>Mommsen declares<a id="footnotetag128" name="footnotetag128"></a>
<a href="#footnote128"><sup class="sml">128</sup></a> that the Olympia were celebrated at the
Olympieum which was begun by Pisistratus; and he adds that
the festival was probably established by him. Of the more ancient
celebration in honor of Zeus, the Diasia, he can only say surely
that it was held outside the city. Certainly we should expect the
older festival to have its seat at the older sanctuary.</p>

<p>The εξω της πολεως<a id="footnotetag129" name="footnotetag129"></a>
<a href="#footnote129"><sup class="sml">129</sup></a>, which is Mommsen's authority in the
passage referred to above, has apparently the same meaning as the
τα εξω (της πολεως) already quoted from Thucydides; <i>i.e.</i>, outside
of the ancient city--the Acropolis and Pelasgicum. The list of
dual sanctuaries, the earlier by the entrance to the Acropolis, the
later to the southeast, is quite a long one. We find two precincts
of Apollo, of Zeus, of Ge, and, as we shall see later, of Dionysus.</p>

<p>Of Ge Olympia we learn<a id="footnotetag130" name="footnotetag130"></a>
<a href="#footnote130"><sup class="sml">130</sup></a> that she had a precinct within the
enclosure of the later Olympieum. Pausanias by his mention of
the cleft in the earth through which the waters of the flood disappeared
and of the yearly offerings of the honey-cake in connection
with this, shows the high antiquity of certain rites here celebrated.
It is indeed most probable that these ceremonies formed
a part of the Chytri; for what seems the more ancient portion
of this festival pertains also to the worship of those who perished
in Deucalion's flood. The worship of Ge <i>Kourotrophos</i> goes
back to times immemorial. Pausanias mentions<a id="footnotetag131" name="footnotetag131"></a>
<a href="#footnote131"><sup class="sml">131</sup></a> as the last shrines
<a name="p63" id="p63"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 63</span>
which he sees before entering the upper city, those of Ge <i>Kourotrophos</i>
and Demeter Chloe, which must therefore have been
situated on the southwest slope of the Acropolis. Here again
near the entrance to the Pelasgic fortification, is where we should
expect <i>a priori</i> to find the oldest religious foundations "outside
the Polis."</p>

<p>The location of the fourth <i>hieron</i> of Thucydides can best be
determined by means of the festivals, more particularly the dramatic
festivals of Dionysus. That the dramatic representations
at the Greater Dionysia, the more splendid of the festivals, were
held on the site of the existing theatre of Dionysus, perhaps from
the beginning, at least from a very early period, all are agreed.
Here was the precinct containing two temples of Dionysus, in the
older of which was the xoanon<a id="footnotetag132" name="footnotetag132"></a>
<a href="#footnote132"><sup class="sml">132</sup></a> brought from Eleutherae by

not held here we have strong assurance. Pausanias<a id="footnotetag133" name="footnotetag133"></a>
<a href="#footnote133"><sup class="sml">133</sup></a> the lexicographer,
mentions the wooden seats in the agora from which the
people viewed the dramatic contests before the theatre έn Διονύσου

<a href="#footnote137"><sup class="sml">137</sup></a> There can be no doubt that in very early times, there
were dramatic representations in the agora in honor of Dionysus;
and there must therefore have been a shrine or a precinct of the
god in or close to the agora. The possibility of presentation of
dramas at Athens, especially in these early times, unconnected
with the worship of Dionysus and with some shrine sacred to him,
cannot be entertained for a moment. It is commonly accepted
<a name="p64" id="p64"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 64</span>
that dramas were represented during two festivals in Athens,--at
the contest at the Lenaeum and at the City Dionysia. The
plays of the latter festival were undoubtedly given in the extant
theatre; but of the former contest we have an entirely different
record. Harpocration say<a id="footnotetag138" name="footnotetag138"></a>
<a href="#footnote138"><sup class="138">138</sup></a> merely that the Limnae were a
locality in Athens where Dionysus was honored. A reference in
Bekker's <i>Anecdota</i> is<a id="footnotetag139" name="footnotetag139"></a>
<a href="#footnote139"><sup class="sml">139</sup></a> more explicit. Here the Lenaeum is described
as a place sacred to (ιερον) Dionysus where the contests

<a href="#footnote140"><sup class="140">140</sup></a> the Lenaeum is said to be an enclosure

the Lenaeum was a large peribolus within the city, in which was
the sanctuary of Dionysus Lenaeus, and that the Athenians held
contests in this peribolos before they built the theatre. Pollux

we find no mention of the Greater Dionysia. But our list of

Lenaea, that the Lenaeum was a place sacred (ιερόν) to Dionysus,

first stood the ληνος or wine-press. He adds<a id="footnotetag148" name="footnotetag148"></a>
<a href="#footnote148"><sup class="sml">148</sup></a> that the contests
in honor of Dionysus took place twice in the year, first in the city

winter. The precinct by the present theatre, as we know, was
sacred to Dionysus Eleuthereus. In this temenus no mention has
been found of Dionysus Λίμναιος or Λήναιος.</p>

<p>Demosthenes tells us<a id="footnotetag149" name="footnotetag149"></a>
<a href="#footnote149"><sup class="sml">149</sup></a> that the Athenians, having inscribed a
certain law (concerning the festivals of Dionysus) on a stone stele,
set this up in the sanctuary of Dionysus εν Λίμναις, beside the
altar. "This stele was set up," he continues, "in the most
ancient and most sacred precinct<a id="footnotetag150" name="footnotetag150"></a>
<a href="#footnote150"><sup class="sml">150</sup></a> of Dionysus, so that but few
should see what had been written; for the precinct is opened only
once every year, on the 12th of the month Anthesterio.</p>

(return) </a> I have translated ιερω by precinct. This is liable to the objection
that ιερον
may also mean temple; and ανοίγεται "is opened" of the passage may naturally
be applied to the opening of a temple. But "hieron" often refers to a sacred precinct,
and there is nothing to prevent the verb in question from being used of a
"hieron" in this sense. If we consult the passages in which this particular precinct
is mentioned we find, in those quoted from Photius and the <i>Etymologicum
Magnum</i>, that the Lenaeum contains a hieron of the Lenaean Dionysus. This might
be either temple or precinct. In the citation from Bekker's <i>Anecdota</i> the Lenaeum
is the hieron at which were held the theatrical contests. This implies that the hieron
was a precinct of some size. The Scholiast to <i>Achar.</i> 202 makes the Lenaeum the
hieron of the Lenaean Dionysus. Here "hieron" is certainly a precinct. Hesych.
(επi Ληναίω αγών) renders this still more distinct by saying that the Lenaeum contained
the hieron of the Lenaean Dionysus, in which the theatrical contests were held.
But Demosthenes in the <i>Neaera</i> declares that the decree was engraved on a stone
stele. It was the custom to set up such inscriptions in the open air. This stele
was also beside the altar. There were indeed often altars in the Greek temple, but
the chief altar (βωμος of the passage) was in the open air. Furthermore, if the decree
had been placed in the small temple, the designation "alongside the altar"
would have been superfluous. But in the larger precinct such a particular location
was necessary. Nor can it be urged, in view of the secret rites in connection with
the marriage of the King Archon's wife to Dionysus on the 12th of Anthesterio,
that hieron must mean temple; since the new Aristotle manuscript tells us that this
ceremony took place in the Bucoleum.</blockquote>

<p>The stele being then visible to the public on but one day of the
year it follows that the entire precinct of Dionysus εν Λίμναις
<a name="p66" id="p66"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 66</span>
must have been closed during the remainder of the year. This
could not be unless we grant that, in the time of Demosthenes at
least, the Lenaea and the Megala Dionysia were held in different
precincts, and that the Lenaea and Anthesteria were one and the
same festival.</p>

<p>Pausanias tells us<a id="footnotetag151" name="footnotetag151"></a>
<a href="#footnote151"><sup class="sml">151</sup></a> that the xoanon brought from Eleutherae
was in one of the two temples in the theatre-precinct, while the
other contained the chryselephantine statue of Alcamenes. We
know, both from the method of construction and from literary
notices, that these two temples were in existence in the time of
Demosthenes. Pausanias says<a id="footnotetag152" name="footnotetag152"></a>
<a href="#footnote152"><sup class="sml">152</sup></a> that on fixed days every year, the
statue of the god was borne to a little temple of Dionysus near
the Academy. Pausanias' use of the plural in τεταγμέναις ημέραις
is excellent authority that the temple of the xoanon was opened
at least on more than one day of every year.</p>

<p>From all these considerations it seems to be impossible that the
precinct of the older temple by the extant theatre and the sanctuary
εν Λίμναις could be the same. The suggestion that the gold and
ivory statue of Alcamenes could have been the one borne in procession
at the time of the Greater Dionysia is, of course, untenable
from the delicate construction of such figures. The massive
base on which it stood shows, too, that its size was considerable.
The image borne in procession was clearly the xoanon which
was brought by Pegasus from Eleutherae.</p>

<p>Wilamowitz calls attention<a id="footnotetag153" name="footnotetag153"></a>
<a href="#footnote153"><sup class="sml">153</sup></a> to another fact. In classic times
the contests of the Lenaea are Διονύσια τα επι Ληναίω, and the
victories are νικαι Ληναϊκαί; the Megala Dionysia are always τα
εν αστει, and the victories here νικαι αστικαί. These words certainly
imply a distinction of place. How early these expressions
may have been used, we learn from the account of Thespis.

<p>But it has also been contended that Limnae and Lemaeum do
not refer to the same locality. It is clear from what has been said,
however, that the Lenaea and the Greater Dionysia must have
been held in different localities. So if Limnae and the Lenaeum
do not refer at least to the same region, there must have been
three separate sanctuaries of Dionysus; for no one will claim that
the Greater Dionysia can have been held in the Limnae if the
Lenaea were not celebrated there. But as we have seen, Hesychius
(v. Λίμναι) declares that the Lenaea were held εν Λίμναις. The
scholiast to Aristophanes says<a id="footnotetag156" name="footnotetag156"></a>
<a href="#footnote156"><sup class="sml">156</sup></a> that the Chytri were a festival of
Dionysus Lenaeus; so the Chytri as well as the Lenaea must
have been celebrated in the Lenaeum. Athenæus in the story of
Orestes and Pandion speaks<a id="footnotetag157" name="footnotetag157"></a>
<a href="#footnote157"><sup class="sml">157</sup></a> of the temenus εν Λίμναις in connection
with the Choes. In Suidas (χόες), however, we learn that
either Limnaeus or Lenaeus could be used in referring to the same
Dionysus. Such positive testimony for the identity of the Lenaeum
and the sanctuary in the Limnae, cannot be rejected.</p>

<p>We have still more convincing testimony that in the great
period of the drama the two annual contests at which dramas
were brought out were held in different places, in the record of
the time when the wooden theatre εν Λίμναις was finally given up,
and ό επι Ληναίω αγών became a thing of the past. The change
comes exactly when we should look for it, when the existing
theatre had been splendidly rebuilt by Lycurgus. The passage
is in Plutarch, where he says<a id="footnotetag158" name="footnotetag158"></a>
<a href="#footnote158"><sup class="sml">158</sup></a> that this orator also introduced
a law that the contest of the comedians at the Chytri should take
place in the theatre, and that the victor should be reckoned eις
άστυ, as had not been done before. He further implies that the
contest at the Chytri had fallen into disuse, for he adds that
Lycurgus thus restored an agon that had been omitted. This
last authority, however, concerns a contest at the Chytri, the
Anthesteria, and is only one of many passages which tend to show
that ό επι Ληναίω αγών was held at this festival. The most weighty
testimony for making the Lenaea an independent festival, even in
historic times, is given by Proclus in a scholium to Hesiod.<a id="footnotetag159" name="footnotetag159"></a>
<a href="#footnote159"><sup class="sml">159</sup></a> He
<a name="p68" id="p68"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 68</span>
quotes from Plutarch the statement that there was no month
Lenaeo among the Boeotians. He adds that this month was the
Attic Gamelio in which the Lenaea were held. Hesychius makes
the same citation from Plutarch<a id="footnotetag160" name="footnotetag160"></a>
<a href="#footnote160"><sup class="sml">160</sup></a> as to a non-existence of a Boeotian
month Lenaeo, and continues: "But some say that this
month is the (Boeotian) Hermaio, and this is true, for the
Athenians [held] in this month (εν αυτω) the festival of the Lenaea."
The great similarity of the two passages renders it very probable
that both were drawn from the same sources. The omission of
Gamelio by Hesychius, by referring the εν αυτω back to Lenaeo,
makes him authority that the Lenaea were held in that month.
This, in turn implies that Proclus may have inserted Gamelio in
order to bring the statement into relation with the Attic months
of his own day. In the authorities referring to this month is a
suggestion of several facts and a curious struggle to account for
them. Proclus cites Plutarch to the effect that there was no month
Lenaeo among the Boeotians, but, being probably misled by the
very passage in Hesiod for which he has quoted Plutarch, he
adds<a id="footnotetag161" name="footnotetag161"></a>
<a href="#footnote161"><sup class="sml">161</sup></a> that they had such a month. He goes on to state that the
month is so called from the Lenaea, or from the Ambrosia. Moschopulus,<a id="footnotetag162" name="footnotetag162"></a>
<a href="#footnote162"><sup class="sml">162</sup></a>
Tzetzes,<a id="footnotetag163" name="footnotetag163"></a>
<a href="#footnote163"><sup class="sml">163</sup></a> and the Etymologicum Magnum<a id="footnotetag164" name="footnotetag164"></a>
<a href="#footnote164"><sup class="sml">164</sup></a> repeat this
last statement. An inscription<a id="footnotetag165" name="footnotetag165"></a>
<a href="#footnote165"><sup class="sml">165</sup></a> referring to a crowning of Bacchus
on the 18th of Gamelio may refer to the same festival.
Tzetzes alone is responsible for the statement that the <i>Pithoigia</i>
came in this month. Through Proclus and Hesychius we are
assured of the belief that there was once an Attic month Lenaeo.
Proclus, Hesychius and Moschopulus tell us that the Lenaea
were at some period held in this month; while Proclus, Moschopulus,
Tzetzes, and the inscription assure us that there was another
festival of Dionysus in this month; and the first three of these
authorities name this festival Ambrosia. A tradition running
with such persistency through so many authors affords a strong
<a name="p69" id="p69"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 69</span>
presumption that there once existed an Attic month Lenaeo, and
that the Lenaea were celebrated in that month.</p>

(return) </a> The entire argument on the question of the month is open to the objection that
too much weight is given to such men as Tzetzes and all the tribe of minor scholiasts,
whose opportunities for accurate knowledge were, in many respects, vastly inferior
to those of scholars of our own day. It is easy indeed to say that their testimony is
worth nothing. But where shall we stop? It is urged that the connection of the
Lenaea with an Attic month Lenaeo arose from an attempt on the part of the commentators
to explain names as they found them. It is said that this conflict of the
authorities proves that there never was an Attic Lenaeo. This may be true; and
the man who will prove it to be so, and furthermore will give us the accurate history
of the Attic and the Ionic calendars, will do a great service to Greek scholarship.
But he must have at hand better sources than we possess to-day. Though
the later Greek commentators on the classics have made many amusing and stupid
blunders, though we need not hesitate to disregard their teaching when it comes into
conflict with better authority, or with plain reason, still they have told us that which
is true. They often furnish us with all that we know of older and better authors,
whose works were their authority. Therefore, unless I have found testimony against
them, I have followed their teaching. Both here and elsewhere I give their words
for what they are worth; not that I rank Proclus with Thucydides, or the Et. Mag.
with Aristophanes,--but from the conviction that so remarkable a concurrence of
testimony in so many different writers has not yet been successfully explained away,
and could not indeed exist unless their testimony were founded on a basis of fact.</blockquote>

<p>This gives a time, however remote it may be, when the Athenians
still had the month Lenaeo, yet we hear of no festival
Lenaea among the Ionian cities. It would thus seem that this had
lost its force as an independent festival before the migration.</p>

<p>Gamelio is said to have received its name from the Gamelia,
the festival of Zeus and Hera. It is hard to believe that while
the much more brilliant Lenaea remained in the month, the name
<a name="p70" id="p70"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 70</span>
should have passed to the always somewhat unimportant Gamelia.
What reason could be found for this naming, unless that the
Lenaea had first been transferred to the Anthesteria, as all the
testimony tends to prove? This supposition gives an easy explanation
of the repeated reference to Lenaeo as an Attic month, of
the change of the name to Gamelio, and even Tzetzes' association
of the Pithoigia with the Lenaea,--an association which arises
necessarily, if the Lenaea once formed part of the Anthesteria.
The impossibility of transferring in its entirety a festival which
has become rooted in the customs of a people, is also seen. That
remnant of the Lenaea in Lenaeo, the Ambrosia, survived till
quite late in Attic history. It is not difficult, then, to understand
why the other references to the Lenaea as a separate festival do
not agree as to the month.</p>

<p>A triad of contests is given by Demosthenes<a id="footnotetag169" name="footnotetag169"></a>
<a href="#footnote169"><sup class="sml">169</sup></a> where he quotes
the law of Evegoras with reference to the Dionysiac festivals: the
one in Piræus with its comedies and tragedies, η επι Ληναίω πομπή
with its tragedies and comedies, and the City Dionysia with the
chorus of boys, procession, comedies and tragedies. Here are
three different contests in three different places; and the Anthesteria
and Lenaea are included under η επι Ληναίω πομπή. The
purpose of the law was to preserve absolute security and freedom
to both person and property on the days of the festivals named.
Not even an overdue debt could be collected. In so sweeping a
law the Anthesteria could hardly fail to be included; for at no
Attic festival was there more absolute liberty and equality. In
Suidas<a id="footnotetag170" name="footnotetag170"></a>
<a href="#footnote170"><sup class="sml">170</sup></a> we learn that the revellers at the Chytri, going about
on carts, jested and made sport of the passers by, and that later
they did the same at the Lenaea. Thus he gives another proof
of the connection between the two festivals, and shows that ο επι
Ληναίω αγων became a part of the older Anthesteria after the invention
of comedy, and that even then the old custom was kept
up. In Athenæus we find<a id="footnotetag171" name="footnotetag171"></a>
<a href="#footnote171"><sup class="sml">171</sup></a> the Samian Lynceus sojourning in
Athens and commiserated as passing his time listening to the lectures
of Theophrastus and seeing the Lenaea and Chytri, in
<a name="p71" id="p71"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 71</span>
contrast to the lavish Macedonian feasts of his correspondent.
The latter in the same connection says<a id="footnotetag172" name="footnotetag172"></a>
<a href="#footnote172"><sup class="sml">172</sup></a> that certain men, probably
players, who had filled a part in Athens at the Chytri, came
in to amuse the guests. The marriage which he is attending
then took place after the Chytri. It is not likely, therefore, that
in "the Lenaea and Chytri" he is referring to two festivals
separated by a month of time. He speaks, rather, of two acts of
the same celebration.</p>

<p>The frogs in Aristophanes claim the temenus Λίμναις and
speak of their song at the Chytri. The scholiast cites<a id="footnotetag173" name="footnotetag173"></a>
<a href="#footnote173"><sup class="sml">173</sup></a> Philochorus,
saying that the contests referred to were the χύτρινοι.</p>

<p>A suspected passage in Diogenes Laertius declares (III 56) that
it was the custom to contend with tetralogies at four festivals, the
Dionysia, Lenaea, Panathenaea, and Chytri. If the passage is
worth anything, it adds new testimony that there were dramatic
representations at the Anthesteria. The Menander of Alciphron,
also, would hardly exclaim<a id="footnotetag174" name="footnotetag174"></a>
<a href="#footnote174"><sup class="sml">174</sup></a> over ποίους χύτρους, unless the contest
were one in which he, as dramatist, could have a part.</p>

<p>No other of the extant dramas has been so much discussed in
connection with the question as the <i>Acharnians</i>. Those who hold
that the Lenaea and Anthesteria were entirely separate, have
affirmed that the play opens on the Pnyx in Athens, that the scene
changes to the country-house of Dicaeopolis in Cholleidae, at the
season of the country Dionysia in the month Posideo. Later
the time of the Lenaea in the month Gamelio is represented.
Finally the locality is again Athens at the Anthesteria in Anthesterio.
In fact, we are told, the poet has, in the <i>Acharnians</i>,
shown his true greatness by overleaping all restraints of time and
place and giving his fancy free rein. But this is making the
<i>Acharnians</i> an isolated example among the Greek plays which
have come down to us. Changes of scene are foreign to the
nature of the Greek drama, as is acknowledged by A. Miller.<a id="footnotetag175" name="footnotetag175"></a>

<p>That the beginning of the play is on the Pnyx, there is no
question. In v. 202, Dicaeopolis declares: "I will go in and
<a name="p72" id="p72"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 72</span>
celebrate the Country Dionysia." This is held to be a statement
of the actual time of year represented in this portion of the play,
and also to indicate the change of place from Athens to the
country. That the country festivals to the wine-god in the different
demes were held on different dates, we learn from the fact
that companies of actors went out from Athens to make the tour
of these provincial festivals.<a id="footnotetag176" name="footnotetag176"></a>
<a href="#footnote176"><sup class="sml">176</sup></a> We know, too, that these rural
celebrations were under charge of the demarchs.<a id="footnotetag177" name="footnotetag177"></a>
<a href="#footnote177"><sup class="sml">177</sup></a> In the passage
from the <i>Acharnians</i> just cited, there is no statement that this is
the season when the demes were accustomed to hold their annual
Bacchic celebrations. Rather, in his joy in his newly concluded
peace, the hero declares that he will <i>now</i> hold this festival in honor
of the god of the vine. No surprise is felt at this exceptional
date, particularly as, by his statement below,<a id="footnotetag178" name="footnotetag178"></a>
<a href="#footnote178"><sup class="sml">178</sup></a> he has been prevented
for six years from holding the festival at its proper season.
This last passage, however, is the strongest authority for a change
of place in the action. Certainly, if the reading is correct, in the
light of all the remainder of the comedy we should naturally
translate: "in the sixth year, having come into my deme, I salute
you gladly." But we do no violence to the construction if we
say that ελθών ες τον δημον means "going (<i>forth</i>) to my deme."
Unquestionably up to the end of the first choral ode at v. 236, the
action has gone on in Athens. But here, we are told, comes the
change of place. In v. 202 Dicaeopolis has declared that he is
"going in." What does he enter but his house in the city? At
v. 236 the chorus also is in Athens. In v. 237, the voice of Dicaeopolis is heard from within--his <i>country</i> house, it is said; and
in v. 238 the chorus is as suddenly before this same house! Such
rapid changes might easily take place on a modern stage, but are
of a character to excite remark in an ancient theatre. If there
was a change here, the second scene must have represented Cholleidae
with the three houses of Dicaeopolis, Lamachus, and Euripides;
and the three must be in the same deme; for the Bacchic
procession of Dicaeopolis appears at v. 241, and is broken up by
the chorus at v. 280. As soon as Dicaeopolis, by his by-play, has
<a name="p73" id="p73"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 73</span>
obtained permission to plead his cause, he turns (v. 394) to the
house of Euripides to borrow the wardrobe of one of the tragic
heroes. Then, when his defense has divided the chorus, the first
half call upon the gorgon-helmeted Lamachus (v. 566) to bear
them aid, and that warrior appears from his house.</p>

<p>Now the common enemy has prevented the celebration of the
Country Dionysia for six years. How is it possible, under such
circumstances, to conceive of Euripides as composing tragedies in
the country? How could the general Lamachus be living out of
the city in such a time of danger? Certainly the play itself
gives us authority that this scene also is in Athens. At v. 241
Dicaeopolis would go forth with his procession to hold the rural
Dionysia in his deme. Prevented from doing so, he is from this
on busy with the duties and pleasures of the Choes. His altercation
with the chorus and with Lamachus ended, he (v. 623 f.)
announces that he will open a market for all Boeotians, Megarians,
and Peloponnesians. He sets up (v. 719) the bounds of his
markets, and appoints three "himantes" as agoranomi. These
officials are suggestive of those busy at the Anthesteria.<a id="footnotetag179" name="footnotetag179"></a>

<p>There is no change of place in the course of the action. The
scene, the Pnyx with the houses of Dicaeopolis, Lamachus, and
Euripides near by, remains the same. There is no indication of a
jump in time from Posideo to Gamelio, and again from Gamelio
to Anthesterio.</p>

<p>Amid all the preparations for the Anthesteria made in the
play, two statements cannot fail to attract attention. In v. 504 f.
the poet informs us that this is not the Greater Dionysia, when
strangers, tribute-bearers, and allies were present. It is the contest
at the Lenaeum. In v. 1150 f. the chorus frees its mind concerning
the miserly fashion in which Antimachus treated them at
a previous celebration of the Lenaea. Shall we say that the poet,
in order to speak of things present before the eyes of the Athenians,
<a name="p74" id="p74"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 74</span>
steps, in these two passages, entirely outside the action of
the play? By no means. The poet is dealing with a vital issue.
He is fighting against the ruinous war. The power of his genius
is shown by the masterly manner in which he uses the moment
which was present to his hearers. The victor at the Choes sat
among the spectators; the very walls of the theatre had hardly
ceased to resound with the din of the carousers. Here, or elsewhere,
there is mention of but one επι Ληναίω αγων, that is the
Lenaea, or the dramatic contest at the Anthesteria.</p>

<p>In fixing the date of the "Dionysia at the Lenaeum," we have
the authority of some interesting inscriptions which have been
collected in Dittenberger S.I.G. II. 374. They are the record
of moneys obtained from the sale of the hides of the victims
sacrificed at various festivals of the Attic year. A portion of
each of four separate lists has been preserved. In the first and
fourth of these, as they stand in Dittenberger, three Dionysiac
festivals are mentioned: that at Piraeus, the Dionysia εν αστει,
and the Dionysia επι Ληναίω. The third list ends with the Dionysia
in Piræus. The remaining incription mentions two Dionysiac festivals,
the one at the Lenaeum, and that εν αστει. The
part of the record which should cover the Dionysia at Piræus is
wanting. The calendar order of all the festivals mentioned is
strictly followed.</p>

<p>Köhler in <i>C.I.A.</i>, led by the other inscriptions found with
these four, says that the lists do not contain mention of all the
festivals at which public sacrifices of cattle were made in that
portion of the year covered by the inscriptions, but that these are
to be considered only as records of the hide-money which was to
be devoted to particular uses. As a matter of fact, however,
nearly all the public festivals of importance, as well as some of
less note, are included in these lists; and it would be difficult to
demonstrate that they do not contain a complete record of the
public hide-money for the portion of the year in which these festivals
fall.</p>

<p>In these inscriptions the peculiarity with reference to the
Dionysia is the same which we find in all other accounts which
seem to give a complete record of these festivals. Only three are
mentioned as held under public authority. Did the omission of
<a name="p75" id="p75"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 75</span>
the Lenaea and Anthesteria occur only in this case, we might,
following Köhler, admit that the hide-money from this particular
festival was not devoted to this special purpose, and that for this
reason the name did not appear in these records. But since in
no case are there more than three mentioned; and since the third
name is one which covers all celebrations in honor of Dionysus at
the Lenaeum, this assumption cannot be granted. The important
point, and one that cannot be too strongly emphasized, is that
neither in these nor in any other inscription or official record is
there any mention of the Lenaea or Anthesteria as such. The
official language appears always to have been, as here: Διονύσια επι Ληναίω, or:
η επι Ληναίω πομπή, or, where the dramatic contest
alone was intended: ό επι Ληναίω αγών. Once only in the
5th century<a id="footnotetag180" name="footnotetag180"></a>
<a href="#footnote180"><sup class="sml">180</sup></a> do we find Λήναια used; and here it is synonymous
with ό επι Ληναίω αγών. Wilamowitz has well said that Λήναια as a name of a
separate festival is an invention of the grammarians.
Aristophanes, in the passage from the <i>Acharnians</i>, shows that this
name may have been used commonly for the dramatic contest at
the Lenaeum, and we know from Thucydides that Anthesteria was
also used of the entire festival. It is impossible that in a record
like the hide-money inscriptions, the official title Διονύσια επι Ληναίω
should be employed to cover two festivals separated by an
interval of a month.</p>

<p>But was the Anthesteria a state festival, at which public sacrifices
of cattle were made? The story of its institution by Pandion
shows that it was public from the beginning. Aristophanes informs
us<a id="footnotetag181" name="footnotetag181"></a>
<a href="#footnote181"><sup class="sml">181</sup></a> that it maintained this character; for the Basileus

the story of the establishment of the Chytri. On the
very day on which they were saved, the survivors of the flood
introduced the celebration of this day of the Anthesteria by
cooking a potful of all sorts of vegetables, and sacrificing it to the
<a name="p76" id="p76"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 76</span>
Chthonian Hermes and those who had perished in the waters.
The scholiast adds that sacrifice was offered to no one of the
Olympian gods on this day.</p>

<p>In Suidas we find a hint of the other ceremonies on the Chytri.
According to him, there were sacrifices to Dionysus as well as to
Hermes. This suggests that the Chytri was but one day of the
Anthesteria, and, though the worship of the departed may have
been the older portion of the celebration, it was later overshadowed
by the festivities in honor of the wine-god. As the text of his
argument in his oration against Midias, Demosthenes cites four
oracular utterances, two from Dodona, the others probably from
Delphi. In the first the god calls upon the children of Erechtheus,
as many as inhabit the city of Pandion, to be mindful of Bacchus,
all together throughout the wide streets to return fit thanks to the
Bromian, and crowned with wreaths, to cause the odor of sacrifice
to rise from the altars. In this oracle, Athens is the city of Pandion,
because it was reported that under his rule the worship of
Dionysus was introduced into the city. This and the other commands
from Dodona and Delphi concerning Dionysus refer to the
introduction of the worship of the god; for in every one the statement
is absolute; there is no reference to a previous worship and
a backsliding on the part of the people, κνισάν βωμοΐσι of the
first oracle can refer only to a sacrifice of animals. Stronger still
is the statement in the fourth oracle (from Dodona) where the
command is given to fulfil sacred rites (ίερα τελεΐν) to Dionysus,
and to sacrifice to Apollo and to Zeus. (Άπόλλωνι Άποτροπαίω
βοūν θυσαι ... Δú Κτησίω βοūν λευκόν.) The command
"to mix bowls of wine and to establish choral dances," in the
second and fourth oracles, serves as an explanatory comment on
"return fit thanks to the Bromian" in the first. "Let free men
and slaves wear wreaths and enjoy leisure for one day," must
refer to the Pithoigia. In this feast the slaves had a part, and
enjoyed a holiday. Hence the saying<a id="footnotetag184" name="footnotetag184"></a>
<a href="#footnote184"><sup class="sml">184</sup></a> "Forth, slaves, it is no
longer the Anthesteria." In obedience to the oracles then, public
sacrifices could not have been lacking at the Anthesteria. Therefore,
this festival must have been officially known as the Dionysia
έπί Ληναίω.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote184"
name="footnote184"></a><b>Footnote 184:</b><a href="#footnotetag184">

<a name="p77" id="p77"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 77</span>

<p>The dramatic contests at the Lenaeum, like those at the Greater
Dionysia, were undoubtedly preceded by sacrifices. The αγων επι Ληναίω
could hardly be separated from the Dionysia επι Ληναίω
Therefore the hide-money inscriptions are also authority that
Lenaea and Anthesteria are but two references to the same festival.</p>

<p>Thucydides, as we have seen,<a id="footnotetag185" name="footnotetag185"></a>
<a href="#footnote185"><sup class="sml">185</sup></a> knew of but two Dionysia in
Athens itself; those εν αστει and the Anthesteria. Of these,
using the comparative degree, he states that the latter were the
άρχαιότερα. In his time the dramatic contests εν Λίμναις were in
their glory, yet he mentions but one celebration in this locality.
So here also we must conclude that Anthesteria was the name of
the whole festival which Harpocration tells us was called πιθοίγια, χοές
and χύτροι; that there was, in the flourishing period of the
drama, no separate festival Lenaea, but that the αγών at the Chytri
came to be so called to distinguish it from that at the City Dionysia.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote185"
name="footnote185"></a><b>Footnote 185:</b><a href="#footnotetag185">
(return) </a> II. 15.</blockquote>

<p>It is interesting in connection with Thucydides' statement that
the Ionian Athenians in his day still held the Anthesteria, to examine
the record of this festival in the Ionic cities of Asia Minor.
To be sure we have very little information concerning the details
of this celebration among them; but we do find two statements
of importance. <i>C.I.G.</i> 3655 mentions certain honors proclaimed
at the Anthesteria in the theatre in Cyzicus. Comparison with
similar observances at Athens indicates that theatrical representations were to follow. <i>C.I.G.</i> 3044, τώγωνος Άνθεστηριοισίν,
refers to Teos. From the constant use of αγών referring to theatrical
performances in connection with the festivals of Dionysus
the word can hardly mean anything else here. So these two
inscriptions, referring to two colonies, add their testimony that
dramas were presented also at the Anthesteria in Athens.</p>

<p>Finally, Aristotle's <i>Politeia</i> falls into line with the
hide-money
records. In § 56, the statement is made that the Archon Eponymos
had the Megala Dionysia in charge. In the following section,
the Archon Basileus is said to have control, not of the Lemaea or
of the Anthesteria--for neither is mentioned by name,--but of the
Dionysia επι Ληναίω. The Basileus and the Epimeletae together
directed the procession; but the basileus alone controlled the
<a name="p78" id="p78"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 78</span>
[dramatic] contest. Here again, it is inconceivable that either
Anthesteria or Lenaea should be omitted; so both must be included
under Dionysia επι Ληναίω.

<p>We thus find our position supported by inscriptions of undoubted
authority, and by a list of names ranging in time from before
Aristophanes to the 9th century A.D., and in weight from Thucydides
and Aristotle to the Scholiasts.</p>

<p>If the Limnae were not by the existing theatre of Dionysus,
where were they? Not on the south side of the Acropolis, as a
careful examination of the ground proves. In our study of the
theatre-precinct, we found that the earth here in antiquity was at
a much higher level than at present, while immediately outside
the wall of this precinct to the south, the ground was considerably
lower than it is now. The present height of the theatre-precinct
is 91.4 m. above the sea level; of the Odeum, 97.7 metres; of the
Olympieum, 80.8 m.; of the ground within the enclosure of the
Military Hospital due south from the theatre, 75 m.; of Callirrhoe
in the Ilissus opposite the Olympieum, 59 m.; of the Ilissus
bed opposite the theatre, 50 m. From the present level of the
theatre to the bed of the stream there is a fall of more than
41 m.; the fall is about equally rapid along the entire extent
of the slope to the south of the Acropolis, while the soil is full of
small stones. Surely, it would take more than the oft-cited handful
of rushes to establish a swamp on such a hillside. We have,
however, excellent geological authority that from the lay of the
land and the nature of the soil, there never could have been a
swamp there. The Neleum inscription<a id="footnotetag186" name="footnotetag186"></a>
<a href="#footnote186"><sup class="sml">186</sup></a> can be held to prove
nothing further than that, as Mr. Wheeler suggests, the drain
from the existing theatre ran through this precinct. We must
therefore seek the Limnae elsewhere.</p>

<p>We know that from time immemorial the potters plied their
trade in the Ceramicus, because here they found the clay suitable
for their use. The so-called Theseum is 68.6 m. above the sea-level;
the present level at the Piræus railroad station, 54.9 m.; at
the Dipylum (and here we are on the ancient level), only 47.9 m.
Out beyond the gate comes a long slope, extending till the Cephissus
<a name="p79" id="p79"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 79</span>
is reached, at an elevation of 21 m. So the Dipylum is
over 43 m. below the present level of the theatre-precinct; and it
is the lowest portion of the ancient city. Here, therefore, in the
northwest part of the city, is where we should expect from the lay
of the land and the nature of the soil to find the marshes. Out in
the open plain beyond this quarter of the city to-day, after every
heavy rain, the water collects and renders the ground swampy.
With the Dipylum as a starting-point, there is no difficulty in supposing
that, in very ancient times, the Limnae extended to Colonus
Agoraeus, to the east into the hollow which became a portion
of the agora in the Ceramicus, and to the west into the depression
between Colonus Agoraeus and the Hill of the Nymphs. The
exact extent and character of the low ground in these two directions
can only be determined by excavating the ancient level,
which, as it appears to me, has not been reached by the deep new
railroad cutting running across this section north of the so-called
Theseum.</p>

<p>The excavations of Dr. Dörpfeld between Colonus Agoraeus and
the Areopagus, have shown that the ruins and the ancient street
at this point have been buried to a great depth by the débris
washed down from the Pnyx. Unfortunately, these diggings have
not been extensive enough to restore the topography of the west
and southwest slopes of Colonus Agoraeus.</p>

<p>We have abundant notices, besides those already given, of a
precinct or precincts of Dionysus in this section. Hesychius
speaks<a id="footnotetag187" name="footnotetag187"></a>

with various αγάλματα, and among them the face of the demon of
unmixed wine, Cratus. Beyond this precinct was a building
with images of clay, representing, among other scenes, Pegasus,
who brought the worship of Dionysus to Athens. This building

also was plainly devoted to the cult of the wine-god. In fact, the
most venerable traditions in Athens, with reference to Dionysus,
centre here. All the various representations here are connected
with the oldest legends. Pausanias (I. 3. 1.) says that the Ceramicus
had its very name from Ceramus, a son of Dionysus and
Ariadne.</p>

<p>We have already seen that an orchestra was first established in
the agora. Timæus adds<a id="footnotetag190" name="footnotetag190"></a>
<a href="#footnote190"><sup class="sml">190</sup></a> that this was a conspicuous place where
were the statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton, which we know

<p>The scholiast to the <i>De Corona</i> of Demosthenes<a id="footnotetag191" name="footnotetag191"></a>
<a href="#footnote191"><sup class="sml">191</sup></a> says that the
"hieron" of Calamites, an eponymous hero, was close to the Lenaeum.
Hesychius words this statement differently, saying that [the
statue of] the hero himself was near the Lenaeum. We know that
the statues of eponymous heroes were set up in the agora. Here
again the new Aristotle manuscript comes to our support, telling
us (<i>Pol</i>. c. 3) that the nine archons did not occupy the same
building, but that the Basileus had the Bucoleum, near the Prytaneum,
and that the meeting and marriage of the Basileus' wife
with Dionysus still took place there in his time. That the Bucoleum
must be on the agora, and that the marriage took place in
Limnaean-Lenaean territory, have long been accepted. The
location of the Limnae to the northwest at the Acropolis must
thus be considered as settled.</p>

<p>Dr. Dörpfeld maintains that the ancient orchestra and the later
Agrippeum theatre near by, mentioned by Philostratus,<a id="footnotetag192" name="footnotetag192"></a>
<a href="#footnote192"><sup class="sml">192</sup></a> lay in

<p>From the passage of the <i>Neaera</i> quoted above we know that the
old orchestra could not have been in the sacred precinct of Dionysus
Limnaeus, for this was opened but once in every year, on the
12th of Anthesterio,<a id="footnotetag193" name="footnotetag193"></a>
<a href="#footnote193"><sup class="sml">193</sup></a> while the Chytri and therefore ό επι Ληναίω αγών

<a name="p81" id="p81"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 81</span>
that the Pithoigia as well as the "contests at the Lenaeum" could
not have been celebrated in the sanctuary εν Λίμναις, though portions
of each of these divisions of the Anthesteria were held in the
Lenaeum, which contained the Limnaea <i>hieron</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote193"
name="footnote193"></a><b>Footnote 193:</b><a href="#footnotetag193">
(return) </a> See also THUCYDIDES above.</blockquote>

<p>The Lenaeum must lie εν Λίμναις, and therefore on the low
ground. A passage in Isæus (8. 35) is authority that the sanctuary
of Dionysus εν Λίμναις was εν αστει; <i>i.e.</i>, within the Themistoclean
walls. So we have it located within narrow limits,
somewhere in the space bounded on the east by the eastern limit
of the agora in Ceramicus, south by the Areopagus, west by the
Pnyx and the Hill of the Nymphs, and north by the Dipylum.</p>

<p>From the neighborhood of the Dionysiac foundations and
allusions mentioned by Pausanias immediately upon entering the
city, we may be justified in locating this ancient cult of Dionysus
εν Λίμναις still more exactly, and placing it somewhere on or at
the foot of the southwestern slope of Colonus Agoraeus. More
precise evidence of its site we may obtain from future excavation:
though as this region lay outside the Byzantine city-walls, the ruins
may have been more or less completely swept away.</p>

<p>In view of its position outside of the gate of the ancient Pelasgic
city, by the wine-press, we understand why the contest in the
Lenaeum was called a contest κατ' αγρούς. Because enclosed later
within the walls of Themistocles, the Limnae were also referred to
as εν αστει. Situated as they were in the territory of the agora,
we see why, although the Archon Eponymus directed the City
Dionysia, the Archon Basileus presided<a id="footnotetag194" name="footnotetag194"></a>
<a href="#footnote194"><sup class="sml">194</sup></a> over the Anthesteria, and
therefore over "the contest at the Lenaeum"; and the agoranomi,

<p>In closing, it may not be without interest to review the picture
presented of the most ancient Athens. Behind the nine-gated
Pelasgic fortifications lay the city, with its temples, its palace, "the
goodly house of Erechtheus," and its dwellings for the people,
remains of which can even now be seen within the Pelasgicum.
Immediately without the gate stood the Pythium, the Olympieum,
the temple of Ge <i>Kourotrophos</i>, and other foundations. Directly
<a name="p82" id="p82"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 82</span>
before the entrance, some two hundred paces from the city-walls,
was the spring Enneacrounus, whose water was most esteemed by
the citizens. Not far from this was the wine-press. Here the
people built the first altar, the first temple, the first orchestra, and
instituted the first festival in honor of the wine-god, long before
the new Dionysian cult was brought in from Eleutherae; and here
for centuries were raised every year about the orchestra tiers of
wooden seats in preparation for the annual dramatic contests.</p>

<h2>CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>


<h3>HUNTING DELLA ROBBIA MONUMENTS IN ITALY.</h3>

<p><i>To the Managing Editor of the American Journal of Archæology:</i></p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>: Having made a special study of
the altarpiece by Andrea Delia Robbia in the Metropolitan Museum,
New York, my desire was aroused to examine all the glazed terracotta
sculptures of the Delia Robbia school, which form such an important
part of Italian Renaissance sculpture. So I sailed for Italy on
the 6th of last May, taking with me a good camera and a sufficient
number of celluloid films, knowing beforehand that there were many
of these monuments which had never been photographed and were
consequently imperfectly known. An investigation of this character,
which takes one over the mountains and into the valleys, from one
end of Italy to the other, may well be described as a hunting expedition;
and, though requiring severe labor and constant sacrifices, has
in it a considerable element of sport. Although Dr. Bode, of Berlin
in various writings has shown a more discriminating knowledge of
this subject than other writers, nevertheless the work of Cavallucci
and Molinier, <i>Les Della Robbia</i>, was more useful to me as a guide and
starter. They had catalogued as many as 350 of these monuments
in Italy, and briefly described them. But their attributions were
uncertain. Prof. Cavallucci told me in Florence that unless he had a
document in hand indicating the authorship of a monument he felt
great hesitation in making attributions. And I could see, the more
I studied his work, that he considered it more important to discover
documents than to observe monuments. Here then was a great
opportunity to see a large series of monuments, to compare them and
allow them to tell their own story in regard to their origin. Having
with the aid of geographical dictionaries and government maps located
these 350 monuments, I made up my mind to see as many of them
as possible. This was no easy task, as they were widely distributed
and, as I progressed, the number of uncatalogued monuments constantly
increased. I can give here but a bare outline of my trip.
Starting at Genoa, I went to Massa and Pisa and Lucca; from Lucca
following the valley of the Serchio as far north as Castelnuovo. Here
<a name="p84" id="p84"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 84</span>
I found a fine series of unphotographed monuments, and began to
learn that works of the same author and period are very likely to be
found in neighboring towns, especially when lying along a valley.
Similarly, starting from Pracchia above Pistoia I studied another series
of unphotographed monuments at Gavinana, Lizano and Cutigliano.
These monuments may prove to be of importance in solving the
problem of the authorship of the celebrated Pistoian frieze.</p>

<p>At Prato the monuments of this class have been photographed,
and are well known. Florence and its immediate surroundings
contain the most important works of Luca and of Giovanni Delia
Robbia, but is very poor in examples of Andrea Delia Robbia. Hence
the Florentines have a very inadequate notion of Andrea's work, which
must be studied at Arezzo, La Verna, Prato, Siena and Viterbo. At
Florence I was fortunate enough to find an unpublished document
ascribing one of the medallions at Or San Michele to Luca Delia
Robbia. Two of these medallions by the elder Luca had never been
photographed before, but have now been taken by Alinari. So far as I
know, the monuments at Impruneta, ten miles from Florence, are
unknown to students of this subject. Three of them have been photographed
by Brogi, who gives no attributions. They are not mentioned
by Cavallucci nor by Dr. Bode; yet they are amongst the very finest
works by Luca Delia Robbia. In the private collection of the Marquis
Frescobaldi I recognized a fine Luca Delia Robbia, and in that of the
Marquis Antinori an excellent example of Giovanni's work. Less
important discoveries made in this region are too numerous to mention.
At Empoli, not many miles from Florence, are several uncatalogued
monuments and a fine example of a tile pavement, which I identified
as Delia Robbia work. I then visited Poggibonsi and Volterra and
Siena, and satisfied myself that the beautiful coronation of the Virgin
at the Osservanza outside Siena is a chef-d'oeuvre of Andrea Delia
Robbia. From Asciano I visited Monte San Savino, Lucignano and
Foiano and took photographs of some fine, unrecognized works of
Andrea Delia Robbia. Another starting point was Montepulciano for
a long drive to Radicofani, a weird Etruscan site, whose churches
contained half a dozen unphotographed Delia Robbias, then to S.
Fiora, whose monuments have a greater reputation than they deserve,
to S. Antimo, a fine Cistercian ruin, and Montalcino. At
Perugia I photographed the monuments of Benedetto Buglione, thus
laying the basis for a study of his works, a number of which may now
be identified. In the case of his pupil, Santi Buglione, I was less
successful, as the chapel at Croce dell'Alpe, which contained two
authenticated altarpieces of his seems to have disappeared, not only
<a name="p85" id="p85"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 85</span>
from sight, but from the memory of the inhabitants of the neighborhood.
So the reconstruction of his style involves a wider stretch of
the scientific imagination. At Acquapendente I found a unique glazed
terracotta altar signed by Jacopo Benevento, at Bolsena took the
first photograph of several monuments, and at Viterbo had photographs
made of the important lunettes by Andrea Delia Robbia.
At Rome I penetrated the mysteries of the Vatican and discovered there
a signed monument by Fra Lucas, son of Andrea Delia Robbia,
and found in the Industrial Museum several monuments, which I
identified as by the same author. Hitherto Fra Lucas has been
known only as the maker of tile pavements. At Montecassiano there
is a large monument concerning which a document has been published
in many Italian journals, ascribing the authorship to Fra
Mattia Delia Robbia. This has been published from a drawing, and
my photograph is the first taken from the original monument. On
the basis of a very imperfect acquaintance with his style, other
monuments are being freely attributed to Fra Mattia. In the Marche
there is a series of terracotta altarpieces attributed to Pietro Paolo
Agabiti, a local painter of the XVI century. These attributions are
purely hypothetical, and the hypothesis that Fra Mattia might have
been their author is now being tested by local archaeologists. I
travelled over a large portion of this province, seeing some important
monuments, but without making discoveries of importance. Umbria
in general proved even less fruitful, the terracotta monuments being
of poor quality and showing little or no Delia Robbia influence.</p>

<p>A very interesting region comprises Città di Castello, Borgo San
Sepolcro, Arezzo and the Casentino. Here Andrea Delia Robbia left
his impress strongly marked, especially in the very beautiful altarpieces
at La Verna. As we approach Florence we find more by Giovanni
and his school, especially noteworthy being the monuments at
Galatrona and San Giovanni.</p>

<p>When obliged to return home there remained very few known Delia
Robbia monuments in Italy which I had not visited; almost everywhere
I found more than had been already catalogued, and my collection
of photographs of these monuments is undoubtedly the most
complete in existence. Already considerable knowledge has been
gained of the differences of style, which characterized the various
members of the school, as I hope to show in a series of articles for the
<i>American Journal of Archæology</i>. In order to complete this work I
shall still have to hunt further in the museums and private collections
of Spain, Portugal, France, England, Germany and Austria. There
are a few Delia Robbia monuments in this country, of which one is in
<a name="p86" id="p86"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 86</span>
Princeton, one in New York, one in Newport, R.I., and several in
Boston.</p>

<p>Beside the direct pleasures of the chase and the bagging of game,
there are many incidental pleasures in such a hunting expedition.</p>

<p>One learns of the whereabouts of other monuments, acquires a
knowledge of the country, of the language, of the people and of all the
local surroundings that help explain to us the significance of the
past.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<h2>REVIEWS ΑND NOTICES OF BOOKS.</h2>
<br>


<p>ΜAXIME COLLIGNON. <i>Histoire de la Sculpture Grecque.</i> Tome I.<br>

Firmin-Didot et Cie. Paris, 1892.</p>


<p>This is the first volume of what is likely to prove for some time to
come the best general history of Greek sculpture. The personal inspection
of monuments made during his connection with the French
school at Athens, and his training as a lecturer at the Faculté des
Lettres at Paris, have given M. Collignon an admirable training for the
production of this book. We see in it also a hearty appreciation of
more specialized work. This is essentially a history from the archæaeological
standpoint, the monuments of Greek sculpture, rather than
written documents, being assumed as fundamental material. In this
respect he represents a more advanced stage of archæological science
than Overbeck. Again we feel in reading the volume the constant
assumption that the history of Greek sculpture is a continuous
evolution. Even when the development is checked, as by the Dorian
invasion, the element of continuity is emphasized. The Dorians construct
new forms out of the elements which they find already established
in Greece. Thus the connecting links evincing the continuous
flow, are not lost sight of when he comes to treat of the different
schools. This regard for the general conditions of development tempers
his judgment and prevents him from formulating or approving of
irrelevant and improbable hypotheses. This is an admirable temper
for one who writes a general history. We do not find here remote
analogies and startling theories. There is an even flow to the narrative
which indicates to us that the knowledge of Greek sculpture is
now more connected, and that many gaps have been filled in the list
during a few years. Yet M. Collignon is not a literary trimmer, steering
a middle course between opposing theories. He merely seeks for near
and probable causes, and is not carried away by resemblances which
have little historical value. His method is fundamentally the historical
method, the four books which compose the first volume
treating of the Primitive Periods, Early Archaic, and Advanced Archaic
Periods, and The Great Masters of the V century. It is unnecessary
to give here the general analysis of the book, as it does not differ
essentially from other similar histories, but we may notice the
<a name="p88" id="p88"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 88</span>
systematic method with which he treats his material. At the opening
of each new period he briefly notes the general historical conditions,
then having classed the monuments by schools he considers the
characteristics of a few representative examples, and finally endeavors
to summarize the style of the school or period. In doing this he is
handling considerable new material which has not yet found its way
into general histories. Even to specialists, this general treatment of a
subject with which they may be familiar in detail, is valuable. The
book is a summary and index to a large number of monographs
scattered in French, German, Greek and English periodicals, and we
find it much more convenient to have these references at the foot of
each page rather than gathered together at the end of the volume as in
Mrs. Mitchell's excellent history. Of course it is no easy matter to
distinguish sharply the characteristics of different schools in a country
as small as Greece, where there was so much interaction, and the
formulas, which are laid down now, may require correction in a few
years. Still the attempt is well made, and is helpful in consolidating
our knowledge.</p>

<p>In a work of whose method we cordially approve, the defects, if
there be any, are likely to be in the way of omission of material or
under-valuation of that which is taken into consideration. In the
direction of omission we find that practically no use whatever has
been made of Cyprus as a school of archaic Greek art, yet there is
considerable material for this in European museums as well as in the
Metropolitan museum in New York. In unduly estimating the value of
the material in hand, we find here and there more influence
attributed to the Phoenicians, than we should be inclined to allow.
For example (p. 43,) the ceiling at Orchomenos, is explained as
Phoenician because of the rosettes, and the same design upon
Egyptian ceilings at Thebes is explained as Phoenician also. Evidently
M. Collignon has not yet learned the grammar of the Egyptian
lotus. We commend him to Prof. Goodyear. He is also in error in
ascribing the first use of the term "lax-archaic" to Brunn's article in
the <i>Muth. Ath.</i> vii. p. 117, for it held an important place in Semper's
classification of Doric monuments made three years earlier. But
these are minor matters. The book is abundantly illustrated, having
twelve excellent plates in lithograph and photogravure, and two
hundred and seventy-eight in the tone process and photoengraving.
We regret that the tone process had not been more extensively used,
as the drawings do not and cannot give a sufficiently full impression
of the objects. However, is it quite proper that the maker of a tone
process plate should sign it as is done here <i>Petit sculpsit</i>?</p>

<p>HEINRICH-BRUNN. <i>Griechische Götterideale in ihren Formen erlüutert.</i><br>
8vo. pp. VIII, 110. München, Verlagsanstalt für Kunst und<br>
Wissenschaft. 1892.</p>

<p>This is not a systematic treatise, but a series of nine papers, all of
which, except the last, have been already published. But we are
grateful to Dr. Brunn and to his publishers for having collected these
articles, which were scattered in various periodicals and written at
wide intervals of time. In their present form they are instructive as
revealing to us Dr. Brunn's general habits of mind in approaching his
subject, as well as more useful and better adapted to a wide circle of
readers. The first of these articles on the Farnese Hera appeared in
the <i>Bullettino dell' Instituto</i>, in 1846, and is described as the "first
attempt at the analytical consideration of the ideal of a Greek God,"
while the entire series may be taken as evidence that "the intellectual
understanding of ideal artistic productions can be reached only on the
basis of a thorough analysis of form." For his analysis of sculptural
form, and his keen intuitions, Dr. Brunn has long been held in high
esteem, and it is interesting to learn what we can of his methods. In
considering the Hera head he first examined the original, afterwards a
cast of it for many hours, then compared these impressions with observations
made upon a human scull. In doing this he brings the work of
art to nature, so as to substantiate or correct his impressions. We see
him following the same method in the articles upon the Medusa and
upon Asklepios. But this reference to nature is for the most part casual
and incidental. It is not to nature but to literature that he resorts for
help. He is not content to trust himself entirely to the method
enunciated in the preface. He does not rest satisfied with the ideals as
he reads them in the sculptured faces. He rather assumes that these
ideals were fixed before they were expressed in marble. He looks at
the heads of Hera and Zeus through "ox-eyed" and "dark-browed"
glasses. He accepts the Divine ideal from the pages of Homer,
rather than from the marble form, whenever it is possible. His mind
is still imbued with doctrines concerning the "eternity of ideas" and
"inward necessity," which he must have reached in some other way
than by the analysis of external forms.</p>

<p>But while we may regard the method as not consistently applied,
we have no fault to find with the method and no sentiment but that of
admiration for the fine powers of observation displayed in these
articles. There seems to be nothing in the form of the eye that
escapes his attention. The slightest variations in the form of the lids,
in the positions of the eyeball, he notices and assumes that they were
<a name="p90" id="p90"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 90</span>
made the vehicles of expression. Similarly the forehead, the mouth,
the chin, the hair are most attentively studied as vehicles of expression.
Surely few, even trained archæologists, can read these pages
without having their powers of observation quickened. By far the
greater portion of workers in the field of Greek sculpture are concerned
at the present time with the morphology of art for the sake of its
history. The analysis of forms is utilized to ascertain an historical
series, to discover schools, to establish dates. Here we find scarcely
a mention of schools or artists, no reference to history and not a date.
The analysis of form leads to the interpretation of monuments and the
establishment of ideals. It is the physiology, not the history of art.
The publishers, who are gaining a world-wide reputation for their
photo process reproductions, have added to this book a series of fine
phototype plates.</p>

<p>TEXTS OF THE PYRAMIDS.--<i>Biblia</i> for November, 1892, contains an
article by Dr. Brugsch on "The Texts of the Pyramids." It mentions
the opening of one of the smaller pyramids of the Sakkarah group
in 1880 by Mariette Pasha and the discovery of a number of hieroglyphic
inscriptions beautifully chiseled into the walls of the inner aisles
and chamber, which gave the name of the maker of the pyramid as
Pepi, and fixed its date at the VI Dynasty or about 3,000 B.C.
Prof. Brugsch then gives an account of his own work at the request
of Mariette upon a second pyramid opened by Mariette's men at
Sakkarah, where the walls of the chamber were covered with hieroglyphic
inscriptions. A granite coffin, also, was found adorned with
hieroglyphics repeating in different places the name of the King.
The inscriptions on the walls had been destroyed in a number of
places by treasure hunters.</p>

<p>Maspero, Mariette's successor, opened a number of pyramids of the
same group and found a great quantity of inscriptions. As a result,
new texts were discovered in a number of pyramids of which three
belonged to the royal houses of the V and VI Dynasties. Maspero
then published a copy of all these inscriptions together with their
translation as far as this was possible.</p>

<p>These discoveries establish the important point in the study of the
language, that its "iconographic phrase" dates from the most ancient
times and goes back even to Menes the first king. The grammar,
vocabulary and the construction of words and sentences betray the
awkward stiffness of a language in its first literary beginnings, but it
is shown in all its youthful strength and pregnance.</p>

<p>A reciprocal comparison of all the texts found establishes the fact
that they belong to a collection of texts known as "the Book."
This "book" contained all the formulas and conjurations used after
<a name="p92" id="p92"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 92</span>
death, is a guide for the deceased in the unknown future, and a book
of charms, in which guise the Egyptian faith made its appearance in
the most ancient period of culture, although containing nothing of the
philosophy or history of the ancient Egyptians, it gives us much
interesting information relating to mythology, geography, astronomy,
botany and zoology.</p>

<p>For the ancient Egyptians believed that their earthly districts, cities
and temples had heavenly counterparts of the same name; in fact,
the whole geography of this world was duplicated in the world to
come. The celestial inhabitants consist of the immortal company of the
"shining" with the solar god at their head. Each constellation is
designated as the abode of the soul of one god benificent or maleficent.
In his wanderings the soul of man came in contact with these abodes
of the evil gods and the book which covered the walls of his mortuary
chamber provided charms which made him proof against harm.</p>

<p>The texts of the pyramids promise to the departed the enjoyment
of a new life which he continues to live in the earth, in the body, in
heaven, in the spirit. The soul had power to reunite itself to the body
at will. We find in the texts mention of Egyptian political institutions
at the remotest period, the existence of a high type of civilization. Agriculture
was highly developed. All the domestic animals, with the
exception of the horse and camel, are introduced, the arts of cooking,
of dressing and of personal adornment, all find mention.</p>

<p>The texts of the pyramids then, though they fail to give us any
information with regard to the life or history of the kings whose
chambers they adorned have still much significance for the universal
history of civilization.</p>
<br>

<p>THE MARRIAGE OF AMENOPHIS IV.--The Amarna tablets show that
Amenophis married other Babylonian princesses besides Thi his first
wife who bore the title of "Royal mother, Royal wife, and Queen of
Egypt." A large tablet on exhibition at the British Museum with
two others in the museum at Berlin and one at Gizeh gives a very
entertaining correspondence between Amenophis and Kallima-Sin,
king of Chaldea and brother of one of Amenophis' wives and father
of two others. The tablet in the British Museum is relative to the
alliance with Lukhaite the youngest daughter of the Chaldean king.</p>

<p>Kallima-Sin is reluctant to give his daughter to the Pharaoh and
advances various reasons for his indisposition while Amenophis
smoothly explains away the various impediments.</p>

<p>Matters take a new turn in the Berlin letter where we find the
Babylonian requesting a wife of the Egyptian monarch, the request
is curtly refused, whereupon Kallima-Sin replies, "Inasmuch as thou
<a name="p93" id="p93"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 93</span>
hast not sent me a wife, I will do in like manner unto thee and hinder
any lady from going from Babylon to Egypt." Another letter however
shows that Kallima-Sin finally consented on condition of large
emolument to send Lukhaite to Egypt, and this very mercenary and
diplomatic alliance was finally made.--<i>Biblia</i>, V, pp. 108, 109.</p>
<br>

<p>THE DATE OF THE FOURTH EGYPTIAN DYNASTY.--Mr. Petrie's statement
in <i>Medum</i> as to the passage-angle of Senefru's pyramid completes a
chain of astronomical evidence proving the commencement of the IV
Dynasty to have been very approximately 3700 B.C.</p>

<p>The entrance passage of the Medum pyramid has a polar distance
(allowing for the azimuth error of the passage) of about 45, and, if
intended for observation of a circumpolar star, fixes the date of the
structure within not very wide limits. Between 4900 and 2900 B.C.
no naked eye star was within this distance of the pole, except the sixth
magnitude star 126 Piazzi (XIII) which was so situate about 3820 to
3620 B.C., its minimum distance being about 36'. Allowing an uncertainty
of a few minutes of arc, a date fifty years on either side of these
extremes would satisfy the requirements of the case.</p>

<p>The passage-angle of the Great Pyramid is 3° 30' below the pole (3°
34' in the built portion, the latest). The Second Pyramid passage has
also an angle of about 3° 31' polar distance (Smyth's measures--Perring
and Vyse, whose angle measures are not accurate, give 4° 5').
Finally the northern "trial-passage" east of the Great Pyramid has
the polar distance 3° 22' + or - 8'. Now at the date 3650 B.C. the
star 217 Piazzi (somewhat brighter than that last named) was at a distance
of 3° 29' from the pole, increasing to 3° 34' by 3630 B.C.</p>

<p>East of the Great Pyramid there are certain straight trenches (one
at the Ν.Ε. corner) running respectively 13° 6', 24° 22', and 75° 58'
east of North and west of South. At about the date named these
trenches pointed very nearly to Canopus at setting and to Arcturus
and Altair at rising, the average error of azimuth being less than a
degree.</p>

<p>But even these differences of half a degree or so are accounted for.
Refraction at the horizon amounts to about 35' of arc; if we assume
that the Egyptian (?) astronomers took it roundly at 30', and that
they intended to observe the stars on the true and not the apparent
horizon, we find the azimuths would have been (3645 B.C.):--</p>

<pre>
Canopus  13°  3' (W. of S.), Trench 13°  6'
Arcturus 24° 23' (E. of N.),    "   24° 22'
Altair   76°  0' (   "    ),    "   75° 58'
</pre>

<p>These figures speak for themselves. The dates 3645 B.C. for the
trenches and external works, and 3630 B.C. for the completion of the
<a name="p94" id="p94"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 94</span>
entrance passage, with an interval of fifteen years, accord with the
probabilities of the case. It should be remembered that they are
deduced quite independently.</p>

<p>The net result is that the three reigns of Senefru, Khuffu, and Kaffra
may be definitely assigned to the century 3700-3600 B.C.--G.F.

<p>THE PETRIE PAPYRI.--A paper was read by Prof. Mahaffy at the
Oriental Congress upon "The Gain to Egyptology from the Petrie
Papyri."--The first part of the papyri placed in his hands by Mr.
Flinders Petrie consisted of classical documents which had already
been printed by the Royal Irish Academy in the Cunningham Memoirs.
Of these a large volume had appeared, which was exciting vehement
controversy in Germany. But in addition to these there was a great
mass of private papers which had not yet been printed, but which had
been deciphered partly by Prof. Sayce and partly by himself. These
papers were in two languages-Greek and demotic, or the popular
language of the Egyptians. These were in part hieroglyphs done into
cursive. Of these demotic fragments a large quantity had been sent
to the British Museum. The Greek papyri still remain in his own
hands. Strange to say, only one of these texts is bilingual. These
interesting documents might be divided into--(1) legal agreements, of
which some were contracts, others receipts, others again taxing agreements;
(2) correspondence, partly of a public and partly of a private
character. In the former were official reports, petitions, complaints.
The private correspondence was especially interesting in showing the
condition of society at that date. A large number of Macedonians
and Greeks were settled in the Fayum under the second Ptolemy,
about 270 B.C. In addition there was a large number of prisoners
from Asia, who must have been brought into Egypt after the great
campaign of the third Ptolemy, about 246 B.C. This mixed body were
the recipients of large grants of land in the Fayum. It was interesting
to find that many of these grants were as large as 100 acres, and
the occupiers are thus called ἑκατοντάρονροι. The farms were divided
into three classes of land. First, there was what was called the Royal
land, probably fruitful land was meant; the second class was called
ἄβροχος, or land still in need of irrigation; and the third ἄφορος, or land
which would bear nothing. This latter was also called ἁλμυρίς, or the
salt marsh, which was still common in Egypt. These recipients or
allottees of land were called by a name familiar to all readers of Greek
history--κληρουχοί. Prof. Mahaffy had found no native landowner
mentioned in the papyri. But in many cases the natives had an
interest in the crops on something like a <i>metayer</i> system. Among the
<a name="p95" id="p95"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 95</span>
crops grown were the vine, olives, wheat, barley, rye. There was
evidence in the legal papers that alienation of these farms was not
allowed. Among the contracts are many between Greeks and natives.
The principal officers of the Nome were the Strategos, the Oeconomos,
and the επιμελητης, or overseer. The commissioner of works had charge
of drainage and irrigation works. It was amusing to find that two
currencies were prevalent at that period, silver and copper. This discovery
disposed of the current theory that the copper currency only
came in under the late Ptolemies. The phrases for the rate of exchange
had long been known--χαλκος ου αλλαγή, but he had now got hold of a
later term, ισόνομος which might be translated 'at par.' These documents
were also valuable, as being transcriptions from Egyptian into
Greek, with respect to our knowledge of the Egyptian language. As
the Egyptians did not write down their vowels, the vocalisation of the
language was hardly yet known. But results of much importance
were gained--first, of a palaeographical, and, secondly, of a linguistic
character. We now know exactly how they wrote in the third century
B.C., and we have also learnt what was the Greek used by the
respectable classes of that epoch. The Greek was far purer and better
than that of the Septuagint would lead us to expect. There was still
a large number of papers to be deciphered, and a large addition to our
knowledge might be expected.--<i>Academy</i>, Sept. 24.</p>
<br>

<p>A GREEK PAPYRUS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.--At the Orientalist
Congress in London a most interesting document was submitted
by the Rev. Professor Hechler. It is a papyrus manuscript discovered
a few months ago in Egypt, and is supposed by some authorities to
be the oldest copy extant of portions of the Old Testament books of
Zachariah and Malachi. These pages of papyrus when intact were
about ten inches high and seven inches wide, each containing 28 lines
of writing, both sides of the sheet being used. The complete line
contains from fourteen to seventeen letters. The sheets are bound
together in the form of a book in a primitive though careful manner
with a cord and strips of old parchment. The Greek is written without
intervals between the words. The papyrus is in fair preservation,
and is believed to date from the third or fourth century. It thus
ranks in age with the oldest Greek manuscripts of the Septuagint
version of the Old Testament in London, Rome and St. Petersburg.
The differences in this papyrus tend to the conclusion that it was
copied from some excellent original of the Septuagint, which was
first translated about the year 280 B.C. The first summary examination
has shown that it has several new readings which surpass some
of the other Septuagint texts in clearness of expression and simplicity
<a name="p96" id="p96"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 96</span>
of grammar. It would also appear that it was copied from another
Septuagint Bible and was not written, as was frequently the case,
from dictation. A second scribe has occasionally corrected some
mistakes of orthography made by the original copyist. These are
still to be distinguished by the different color of the ink.</p>

<p>Professor Hechler said it was sincerely to be hoped that this papyrus
of the Bible, probably the oldest now known to exist, would soon be
published in fac-simile.</p>
<br>

<p>THE DATE OF THE AEGEAN POTTERY.--Quite a discussion has been
carried on between Mr. Flinders Petrie and Mr. Cecil Torr on the
subject of the period of the Aegean pottery in Egypt which Mr. Torr
regards as having been assigned to too early a date by Mr. Petrie.
The recent discovery of such fragments in the ruins of the palace of
Khuenaten at Tell-el-Amarna, which existed for little over half a
century in the xiv century B.C., would appear to prove beyond doubt
the correctness of Mr. Petrie's position.--See <i>Classical Review</i> for
March; Academy, May 14 and 21, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>A PROFESSORSHIP OF EGYPTOLOGY.--Miss A.B. Edwards has left
almost the whole of her property to found a professorship of Egyptology,
under certain conditions, at University College, London, The
value of the chair will amount to about $2,000 a year. Mr. W.M.
Flinders Petrie has been appointed to this chair, and no better selection
could have been made.</p>
<br>

<p>EXCAVATIONS BY DR. BRUGSCH, COUNT D'HULST AND M. NAVILLE.--Dr.
H. Brugsch has been excavating during the past spring in the Fayoum.
At Hawara he has discovered a considerable number of painted
portraits. At Illahun he opened a tomb of the eleventh dynasty,
which had not been entered since the mummy was originally deposited
in it. Unfortunately the roof fell in before it could be properly
cleared out. At Shenhour he came across the remains of a small
temple. Since leaving the Fayoum he has been working on the site
of Sais.</p>

<p>Count d'Hulst has been excavating at Behbet, near Mansourah, on
behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund. The ruined temple there
is Ptolemaic, but the cartouche of Ramses II has been found in the
course of the excavations.</p>

<p>Mr. Naville has returned to Europe. His excavations at Jmei el-Amdîd,
the supposed site of Mendes, have been unfruitful, and he has
fared no better at Tel el-Baghliyeh.--<i>Athenaeum</i> May 16.</p>

<p>EXCAVATIONS BY LIEUT. LYONS AT WADY HALFAH, ABUSIR, MATUGAH.--Lieut.
H.G. Lyons has been continuing exploration at <i>Wady
Halfah</i>. He has cleared out the sand from one of the temples, and
found there eleven slabs with figures of a king making offerings to the
god Horus of Behen or Wady Halfah in a chamber in front of the
Hall of Columns. The names in the cartouches have been erased, and
it is, therefore, impossible to identify the king. A second temple,
with sandstone pillars and mud brick walls, is inscribed in many places
with the name of Thothmes IV. This building had been flooded and
filled to a depth of 2 ft. with fine sand. The third temple of Wady
Halfah was completely surrounded by a line of fortifications, the flanks
of which rest on the river, but of these works only the foundation
remains. The discovery of them is, however, decidedly important, for
in them we must see beyond doubt the great frontier fortress which
marked the limit of the rule of Egypt on the south.</p>

<p>About five miles beyond the rock of <i>Abusir</i>, Lieut. Lyons has excavated
the large space, about two hundred yards square, which is
mentioned in Burckhard's 'Travels in Nubia,' and upon which stand
the ruined walls of what has been variously described as a Roman
fort or a monastery. He has come to the conclusion that the building
is undoubtedly Egyptian, and has traced the site of the ancient stone
temple inside it.</p>

<p>He reports that he has discovered old Egyptian fortresses at Halfa
and at Matuga, twelve miles south, the latter containing a cartouche
of Usertesen III: and has opened three rocktombs at Halfa.--<i>Academy</i>,
July 16 and Aug. 6.</p>
<br>

<p>NOTES BY PROF. SAYCE.--Besides Tel el-Amarna, I have visited
El-Hibeh and the little temple of Shishak, which was uncovered there
last year. It is, unfortunately, in a most ruinous condition. One of
the natives took me to a recently-found necropolis at a place under
the cliffs called Ed-Dibân, some two miles distant, which is plainly of
the Roman age, and its occupants belonged to the poorer classes.</p>

<p>In the White Monastery near Sohâg, I found a stone with the cartouche
of Darius, which had formed part of the ancient temple of
Crocodilopolis.</p>

<p>I picked up some fine flint spear-heads near the line of Roman
forts on the north side of the Gebel Sheikh Embârak, where I discovered
an enormous manufactory of flint weapons and tools three
years ago.</p>

<p>Lastly, I may add that at the back of the Monastery of Mari Girgis,
about three miles south of Ekhmim, I found that another cemetery of
the early Coptic period has been discovered, and that it is providing
<a name="p98" id="p98"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 98</span>
the dealers with fresh supplies of ancient embroideries.--A.H. SAYCE,
in <i>Academy</i>, Feb. 27.</p>
<br>

<p>PRESERVATION OF MOHAMMEDAN MONUMENTS.--The Soc. for the Protection
of Ancient Buildings has protested, through Sir Evelyn Baring,
against the so-called restoration of the mosque El-Mouyayyed and the
mosque of Barkouk. It is proposed to rebuild the domed minaret
of Barkouk's mosque and the suppressed bell-tower of the Sultan's
mosque, which is to be replaced by a bulbous roof.--<i>Chron. des Arts</i>,
1892, No. 31.</p>
<br>

<p>ABU-SIMBEL.--The Council of Ministers has granted £1,000 for the
preservation of Abu-Simbel, which is in danger of partial destruction.
The rock above the four colossi on the façade, which is of sandstone
with layers of clay, had become fissured, threatening an immediate
fall. A party of sappers from the army of occupation have been sent
to the temple, who, after binding with chains the falling rock, will
break it up. Further examination will be made to ascertain whether
additional work is required for the protection of this temple.--<i>Academy</i>,
March 5.</p>
<br>

<p>ASSOUAN.--DAM.--A huge dam is to be thrown across the Nile at
Assouan: its height will raise the water to the level of the floors of
the ruins at Philae, enhancing rather than detracting from their picturesque
grandeur. It is said that the structure of the dam will harmonize
with the ancient architecture of Philae. The material already
cut and lying in the quarries of Assouan will be almost sufficient to
complete the dam.--<i>Biblia</i>, V. p. 109.</p>
<br>

<p>TOMBS.--Some new tombs have been opened, one by the Crown
Princess of Sweden and Norway, the other by Mr. James. One
of them belonged to the reign of Nofer-Ka-Ra; and, in an inscription
found in it, Prof. Schiaparelli has read the name of the land of
Pun, which accordingly, was already known to the Egyptians in the
age of the dynasty.--PROF. SAYCE in <i>Academy</i>.</p>
<br>

<p>CAIRO (NEAR). DESTRUCTION OF AN ANCIENT CHRISTIAN CHURCH.--Rev. Greville
J. Chester writes (<i>Acad.</i> March 19). "Permit me to draw public attention
to an almost incredible act of vandalism which was perpetrated
during the last year in Egypt, close to the capital. The finest Roman
ruin in Egypt was the fortress of Babylon, south of Cairo, known also
as Mus'r el Ateekeh and Dayr esh Shemma. One of the most interesting
sights in that Dayr was the Jewish synagogue, anciently the
Christian Church of St. Michael, but desecrated by being handed over
in the middle ages by an Arab Sultan to the Jews, and thenceforward
<a name="p99" id="p99"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 99</span>
to the present time used by them as a place of worship. The building
was of much architectural interest. The old Christian nave and
aisles were preserved intact; but the Jews had destroyed the apse
which must have existed, and had replaced it by a square Eastern
sanctuary, and over the niche, within which were preserved the Holy
Books of the Law, had adorned the wall with numerous Hebrew
texts executed in gesso, forming an interesting example of Jewish
taste and work in the middle ages. Some of the ancient Christian
screenwork of wood was preserved, but was turned upside down,
probably because gazelles and other animals formed part of the design.
Behind this building, in a sort of court, the very finest portion of the
original wall of the Roman fortress was visible, and, what is more
important, the inner and most perfect circuit of one of the Roman
bastion-towers, which outside looked out on the desert.</p>

<p>All this is now a thing of the past. The Jews have razed the
ancient church and synagogue to the ground, and in its place have
erected a hideous square abomination, supported internally on iron
pillars. Of the fine Roman wall which bounded the property, and
with it the bastion-tower, with its courses of brick at regular intervals,
and its deeply-splayed windows, not a vestige now remains."</p>
<br>

<p>CAIRO.--GIZEH MUSEUM.--M. de Morgan has been appointed director of
the Museum in place of M. Grébaut. This will meet with general
approval. He is young and energetic, and the work he has done in
the Caucasus and in Persia has placed him in the front rank of archaeologists
and explorers. Moreover, he is an engineer, and therefore
possesses a practical knowledge which, in view of the conservation of
the ancient monuments of Egypt, is a matter of prime importance.
He has asked the Board of Public Works for £50,000 in order to secure
the building against fire; it is built of very inflammable material. During
the past summer the museum has been entirely rearranged by him.
Of the rooms in the palace, only some thirty-eight contained antiquities
last winter; now, however, about eighty-five are used as exhibition
rooms, and, for the first time, it is possible to see of what the Egyptian
collection really consists. On the ground floor the positions of several
of the large monuments have been changed, and the chronological
arrangement is better than it was before. In one large room
are exhibited for the first time eleven fine <i>mastaba</i> stelæ of the Ancient
Empire, (VI. Dyn.) which were brought from Sakkarah during the past
summer; they are remarkable for the brightness of the colours, the
vigour of the figures, and the beauty of the hieroglyphics. On the
same floor are two splendid colossal statues of the god Ptah which
have been excavated at Memphis during last summer, and many other
<a name="p100" id="p100"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 100</span>
large objects from the same site. In a series of rooms, approached
from the room in which the Dêr el-Bahari mummies are exhibited,
are arranged the coffins and mummies of the priests of Amen which
were brought down from Thebes two years ago. The coffins are of
great interest, for they are ornamented with mythological scenes and
figures of gods which seem to be peculiar to the period immediately
following the rule of the priest-kings at Thebes, <i>i.e.</i>, from about B.C.
1000 to 800.</p>

<p>A new and important feature in the arrangement of the rooms on
the upper floor is the section devoted to the exhibition of papyri.
Here in flat glazed cases are shown at full length fine copies of the
'Book of the Dead,' hieratic papyri, including the unique copy of the
'Maxims of Ani.' and many other papyri which have been hitherto
inaccessible to the ordinary visitor. To certain classes of objects, such
as scarabs, blue glazed <i>faïence</i>, linen sheets, mummy bandages and
garments, terracotta vases and vessels, alabaster jars, etc., special
rooms are devoted. The antiquities which, although found in Egypt,
are certainly not of Egyptian manufacture, <i>e.g.</i>, Greek and Phœnician
glass, Greek statues, tablets inscribed in cuneiform from Tel el-Amarna,
etc., are arranged in groups in rooms set apart for them; and
the monuments of the Egyptian Christians or Copts are also classified
and arranged in a separate room.--<i>Athenæum</i>, May 14 and Nov. 19.</p>
<br>

<p>THE FRENCH SCHOOL AT CAIRO.--M. Maspero analyzed before the <i>Acad.
des Inscr.</i> (Oct. 28), the recent work and immediate prospects of the
French School at Cairo. The <i>Memoirs</i> recently issued show the field
that it covers at present. First comes a fascicule of Greek texts, the
mathematical papyrus of Akmim, explained and commented by M.
Baillet; a long fragment of the Greek text of the Book of Enoch,
remains of the apocryphal Gospel and Apocalypse of St. Peter,
reproduced by M. Bouriant. All these works are of extreme importance
for primitive church history. Arab archæology is represented
by memoirs of M. Casonova on an Arab globe, on sixteen
Arab steles, and especially by M. Burgoin's great work on Arab art
in Egypt. Father Scheil makes an incursion into Assyriology by his
publication of some of the Tel el-Amarna tablets, and in this connection
M. Maspero states that the intention of the school is to extend
their researches to Syria and Mesopotamia and to include the entire
East both ancient and modern. In the Egyptian domain, besides
the Theban fragments of the Old Testament and the remains of the
Acts of the Council of Ephesos, the notable event is the appearance
of the first fasciculus of the work on <i>Edfu</i> by M. de Rochemonteix. In
it a complete temple will be placed before students. The entire
<a name="p101" id="p101"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 101</span>
Egyptian religion will be illustrated, in all its rituals,--ritual of
foundation, of sacrifice, of the feast of Osiris. M. Benedite has commenced
in the same way the publication of the Temples of Philae.--
<i>Revue Critique</i>, 1892, No. 45.</p>

<p>The investigations enumerated above are far from being all. They
represent merely the official governmental side of the work. The
learned societies have done a great deal; such as the Ecole des lettres
of Algiers, the management of historical monuments (Tebessa), and
the French School of Rome.</p>
<br>

<p>EL-KARGEH.--PLASTER BUSTS.--At a meeting of the <i>Académie des Inscriptions</i>,
M. Héron de Villefosse exhibited four painted plaster busts from
El-Kargeh, in the Great Oasis, which have recently been sent to the
Louvre by M. Bouriant, director of the French School at Cairo. They
have been taken from the lids of sarcophagi; but the peculiarity about
them is that the heads were not in the same plane with the body, but
as it were erect. The features have been modelled with extraordinary
verisimilitude; the eyes are of some glassy material, in black and
white; the hair was modelled independently, and afterwards fitted to
the plaster head; the painting is in simple colours--various shades of
red for the skin, and black or brown for the hair. M. Héron de Villefosse
maintained that they were certainly portraits. The physiognomy
of one is Jewish; another recalls a bronze head from Cyrene in
the British Museum, which Fr. Lenormant considered to be of Berber
type; the third might be Syrian, and the fourth Roman. The date is
probably about the time of Septimius Severus. M. Maspero declared
that he had never seen anything of the kind in any museum.--<i>Academy</i>,
July 9.</p>

<p>These busts have been placed on exhibition at the Louvre, in the
<i>Salle des fresques</i>.--<i>Chron. des Arts</i>, 1892, No. 28.</p>

<p>According to a writer in the <i>Temps</i>, two are Greeks, one Syrian and
one a Jew. The Greeks are blond with straight hair; the others have
dark brown curly hair. All are bearded. The drapery is white.--<i>Chron.
des Arts</i>, 1892, No. 30.

<p>The department of Greek and Roman antiquities at the Louvre has
also received from M. Bouriant two funerary inscriptions found in the
necropolis dating from the second century A.D. One is Latin, tha
other Greek.--<i>Chron. des Arts</i>, 1892, No. 32.</p>
<br>

<p>CHATBI (NEAR).--NECROPOLIS.--M. Botti has discovered between Chatbi
and Ibrahimieh a Roman necropolis of the first or second century A.D..
at a depth of fourteen metres. It is excavated in soft calcareous stone
and its chambers and corridors are reached by a rock-cut staircase.

The bodies are both laid on the floor and placed in jars. They were
intact.--<i>Chron. des Arts</i>, 1892, No. 30.</p>
<br>

<p>EL-QAB.--Mr. Taylor has been excavating here for the Egypt exploration
fund, in continuation of the previous year's work. Prof. Sayce
reports, after Mr. Taylor's departure (<i>Acad.</i>, March 12), that more of
the foundations of the old temple which stood within the temple were
then visible than the preceding year. The fragmentary remains
show that among its builders were Usertesen (xii dyn.), Sebekhotep
II (xiii dyn.), Amenophis I and Thothmes III (xviii dyn.) and
Nektanebo I (xxx dyn.) In one of the tombs Nofer-Ka-Ra is alluded
to as (apparently) the original founder of the sanctuary.</p>
<br>

<p>GEBELEN.--TEMPLE OF HOR-M-HIB.--Prof. Sayce writes. "On the voyage
from Luxor to Assuan I stopped at Gebelon, and found that the
Bedouin squatters there had unearthed some fragments of sculptured
and inscribed stones on the summit of the fortress built by the priest-king
Ra-men-kheper and queen Isis-m-kheb to defend this portion of
the Nile. On examination they turned out to belong to a small temple
which must once have stood on the spot. The original temple, I
found, had been constructed of limestone by Hor-m-hib, the last king
of the xviii dynasty, and brilliantly ornamented with sculpture and
painting. Additions had been made to the temple, apparently by
Seti I.; since besides the stones belonging to Hor-m-hib, there were
other fragments of the same limestone as that of which the temple of
Seti at Abydos is built, and covered with bas-reliefs and hieroglyphs
in precisely the same delicate style of art. Eventually a building of
sandstone had been added to the original temple on the west side by
Ptolemy VII Philometor. It may be noted that Ra-men-kheper used
bricks burnt in the kiln as well as sun-dried bricks in the construction
of the fortress, as he also did in the construction of the fortress
at El-Hibeh.--<i>Academy</i>, March 12.</p>
<br>

<p>HAT-NUB.-THE EARLY QUARRY.-This interesting quarry has been
recently discovered by Mr. Griffith. Mr. Petrie writes : Allow me to
note that in this quarry, described by Mr. Griffith (<i>Academy</i>, Jan. 23),
and situated ten miles southeast of El Tell in this plain, the main
quarry does not contain any name later than the vi Dynasty. The
tablet in the thirtieth year being of Pepi II (Nefer-ka-ra), and mentioning
the <i>sed</i> festival in that year, this might refer to the Sothiac
festival of 120 years falling in that year, and so be important as a
datum. There are seven painted inscriptions of Pepi II, containing
about fifty lines in all. There are also a great number of incised
graffiti.--<i>Academy</i>, Feb. 20.</p>

<p>HAWARA.--MUMMY PORTRAITS.--Among the most important discoveries
of the year is that by Dr. Brugsch, of three mummy portraits in the
desert of Hawara. These were found, uncoffined, and buried at a
very slight depth below the surface.</p>

<p>The first is that of a woman: the portrait is brilliantly executed in
tempera, on canvas, and is the most ancient of paintings on canvas
known, for its date cannot be fixed later than the first century B.C.</p>

<p>The next portrait was on the mummy of a man but instead of a
painting on canvas is a relief in stucco, gilded. The features are carefully
reproduced, as are the beard and whiskers.</p>

<p>The third mummy was provided with a beautifully executed portrait
on wood which is one of the best examples of ancient painting,
though not so rare as the other, for ancient portraits painted on wood
have long been known.--<i>Biblia</i>, V. P.</p>
<br>

<p>HELIOPOLIS.--M. Philippe, the Cairo dealer in antiquities, is, with
permission from the Gizeh Museum, carrying on excavations at Heliopolis,
which have brought to light some tombs of the Saïtic period.--<i>Academy</i>,
Nov. 12.</p>
<br>

<p>KOM-EL-AHMAR.--"At Kom el-Ahmar, opposite El-Qab, I visited two
recently-discovered tombs, which contain the cartouches of Pepi, and
are in a fairly perfect condition. The walls are covered with delicate
paintings in the style of those of Beni-Hassan, and explanatory
inscriptions are attached to them. The early date of the paintings
and inscriptions makes them particularly interesting. The tombs are
still half buried in the sand, and only the upper part of the internal
decoration is visible."--PROF. SAYCE, in <i>Academy</i>, April 2.</p>
<br>

<p>MEIR.--The authorities of the Gizeh Museum have, on the suggestion
of Johnson Pasha, caused excavations to be made at Meïr, near
Deirut, in Upper Egypt, which have already resulted in the discovery
of some tombs of the XI dynasty. It is intended to continue these
excavations.--<i>Academy</i>, Nov. 12.</p>
<br>

<p>MEMPHIS.--DISCOVERIES BY M. DE MORGAN.--At a meeting of the <i>Acad.
des Inscr.</i> Prof. Maspero communicated the result of the excavations on
the site of Memphis by M. de Morgan. He has discovered among the
ruins of the temple of Ptah a number of monuments of importance.
First, a large boat of granite, similar to that in the museum at Turin, on
which the figures are destroyed; next, several fragmentary colossi of
Rameses II, and in particular two gigantic upright figures, dedicated
by this king, of Ptah, the god of Memphis, enshrouded in mummy-wrappings
and holding a sceptre in both hands; lastly, some isolated
figures, arranged in a court or a chamber. The importance of this
<a name="p104" id="p104"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 104</span>
discovery, said Prof. Maspero, will be realised when we bear in mind
that we possess no divine image of large size, and that the very
existence of statues of gods in Egyptian temples has sometimes been
denied.--<i>Academy</i>, Sept. 17.</p>
<br>

<p>SEHEL.--THE TENTH DYNASTY.--Prof. Sayce reports that he has been
finding evidences of the little-known X dynasty in the immediate
neighborhood of the First Cataract. "Mr. Griffith and Prof. Maspero
have shown that certain of the tombs at Siût belonged to the period
when this dynasty ruled in Egypt. I have now discovered inscriptions
which show that its rule was recognized on the frontiers of Nubia.</p>

<p>"An examination of the position occupied by the numerous inscriptions
on the granite rocks of the island of Sehêl have made it clear to
me that we must recognize two periods in the history of the sanctuary
for which the island was famous. During the second period the
temple stood on the eastern slope of an eminence where I found
remains of it two years ago. As I also found fragments of it bearing
the name of Thothmes III on the one hand, and of Ptolemy Philopator
on the other, it must have existed from the age of the XVII
dynasty down to Ptolemaic times. Throughout this period the inscriptions
left by pious pilgrims to the shrine all face the site of the
temple. So also do a certain number of inscriptions which belong to
the age of the XII and XIII dynasties. But the majority of the inscriptions
which belong to the latter age, like the inscriptions which are
proved by the occurrence of the names of Antef and Mentuhotep to
be of the time of the <i>xi</i> dynasty, face a different way. They look
southward.</p>

<p>"This winter I have come across a large number of inscriptions on the
mainland side of the channel which look northward, that is, towards
the island. A few of these inscriptions are of the time of the XII
dynasty, but the greater number belong to the XI dynasty, and one is
dated in the forty-first year of Ra-neb-kher. It would seem, therefore,
that at the epoch when they were inscribed on the rocks the sanctuary
of Sehêl stood either in the middle of the southern channel of the
river or upon its edge.</p>

<p>"On the island side of the channel there are a good many inscriptions
which are shown by the weathering of the hieroglyphs to be older
than the age of the XI dynasty. Indeed, the inscription of an Antef
is cut over one of them. They all present the same curious forms
of hieroglyphic characters, and contain for the most part titles and
formulæ not met with in the later texts. Moreover, they are not
dedicated like the later texts to the divine trinity of the Cataract,
Khnum, Anuke, and Sati, but to a deity whose name is expressed by
<a name="p105" id="p105"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 105</span>
a character resembling an Akhem seated on a basket. Mr. Wilbour
and I first noticed it last year.</p>

<p>"One of the early inscriptions contains a cartouche which reads
Ra-nefer-hepu, the last element being represented by the picture of a
rudder. Now Mr. Newberry and his companions at Beni-Hassan
have discovered that one of the groups of tombs which exist there is
of older date than the time of the XII dynasty. In this group of
tombs occurs the name of a lady who was called Nefer-hepu. She
must have been born in the reign of Ra-nefer-hepu, and will consequently
belong, not to the age of the XI dynasty, but to that of one
of the dynasties which preceded it.</p>

<p>"That this dynasty was the X is made pretty clear by the inscriptions
on the mainland side of the channel I have described. Here I
have found inscriptions of the early sort mingled with those of the XI
dynasty in such a way as to show that they cannot have been widely
separated in age. Moreover, in one of them, the name of Khatî is
associated with that of Ra-mer-ab; and Khatî is not only a name which
characterises the XI dynasty, but it was also the name of the owner of
one of the tombs at Siût, which Mr. Griffith has proved to belong to
the time of the X dynasty. We were already acquainted with the
name of Ra-mer-ab from a scarab; and two years ago Mr. Bouriant
obtained a bronze vase which gave the double name of Ra-mer-ab
Kherti. Kherti is a king of the X dynasty. By the side of the inscription
which contains the name of Ra-mer-ab, I found others with the
names of Ra-mer-ankh and Ameni. That Ameni was a king of the X
dynasty has already been suspected.</p>

<p>"The inscriptions I have copied this winter, therefore, have not only
given us the names of some kings of the X dynasty, one of them previously
unknown; they have also shown that the power of the dynasty
was acknowledged as far south as the Cataract. Moreover, they
indicate that the government must have passed from the X to the XI
dynasty in a peaceful and regular manner."</p>
<br>

<p>SHAT-ER-RIGALEH.--Prof. Sayce writes: "I have visited the famous
"Shat er-Rigâleh," the valley a little north of Silsilis and the village
of El-Hammâni, in which so many monuments of the XI dynasty have
been discovered by Messrs. Harris, Eisenlohr, and Flinders Petrie.
To these I have been able to add another cartouche, that of Ra-nofer-neb,
a king who is supposed to belong to the XIV dynasty. His name
and titles have been carved on the rock at the northern corner of the
entrance into the valley by a certain Ama, a memorial of whom was
found by Mr. Petrie in the Wadi itself (<i>A Season in Egypt</i>, pl. XV. No.
438). Mr. Spicer, whose dahabiyeh accompanied mine, photographed
<a name="p106" id="p106"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 106</span>
the inscriptions in which Mentuhotep-Ra-neb-kher of the XI dynasty
is mentioned, as well as the one which enumerates the names of three
kings of the XVIII dynasty, Amenophis I, Thothmes I, and Thothmes
II. One of the inscriptions of Mentuhotep is dated in the thirty-ninth
year of the king's reign. The epithet <i>mâ-kheru</i> "deceased" is
attached only to the cartouche of Amenophis I, not to those of the
other two kings, proving that they reigned contemporaneously."--<i>Academy</i>,
March 12.</p>
<br>

<p>TEL EL-AMARNA.--EXCAVATIONS BY MR. PETRIE.--Mr. Petrie communicates
the following report to the <i>Academy</i>: "During the last four
months I have been excavating at this place, the capital of Khuenaten.
Past times have done their best to leave nothing for the present--not
even a record. The Egyptians carried away the buildings in whole
blocks down to the lowest foundations, completely smashed the sculptures,
and left nothing in the houses; and the Museum authorities,
and a notorious Arab dealer, have cleared away without any record
what had escaped the other plunderers of this century. I have now
endeavoured to recover what little remained of the art and history of
this peculiar site, by careful searching in the town. From the tombs
I am debarred, although the authorities are doing nothing whatever
there themselves, and the tomb of Khuenaten remains uncleared, with
pieces of the sarcophagus and vessels thrown indiscriminately in the
rubbish outside.</p>

<p>The region of main interest is the palace; and the only way to
recover the plan was by baring the ground, and tracing the bedding
of the stones which are gone. For this I have cleared all the site of
the buildings, and in course of the work several rooms with portions
of painted fresco pavements have been found. One room which was
nearly entire, about 51 by 16 feet, and two others more injured, have
now been entirely exposed to view, and protected by a substantial
house, well lighted, and accessible to visitors, erected by the Public
Works Department. With the exception of a pavement reported to
exist at Thebes, these are the only examples of a branch of art which
must have been familiar in the palaces of Egypt. The subjects of
these floors are tanks with fish, birds, and lotus; groups of calves,
plants, birds, and insects; and a border of bouquets and dishes. But
the main value of these lies in the new style of art displayed; the
action of the animals, and the naturalistic grace of the plants, are
unlike any other Egyptian work, and are unparalleled even in classical
frescoes. Not until modern times can such studies from nature be
found. Yet this was done by Egyptian artists; for where the lotus
occurs, the old conventional grouping has constrained the design, and
<a name="p107" id="p107"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 107</span>
the painter could not overstep his education, though handling all the
other plants with perfect individuality. That Babylonian influence
was not active, is seen by the utter absence of any geometrical ornament;
neither rosettes or stars, frets or circles, nor any other such
elements are seen, and perhaps no such large piece of work exists so
clear of all but natural forms. Some small fragments of sculptured
columns show that this flowing naturalism was as freely carried out
in relief as in colour.</p>

<p>Of the architecture there remain only small pieces flaked off the
columns. By comparing these the style can be entirely recovered;
and we see that both the small columns in the palace, and those five
feet thick in the river frontage, were in imitation of bundles of reeds,
bound with inscribed bands, with leafage on base and on capital, and
groups of ducks hung up around the neck. A roof over a well in the
palace was supported by columns of a highly geometrical pattern,
with spirals and chevrons. In the palace front were also severer
columns inscribed with scenes, and with capitals imitating gigantic
jewellery. The surface was encrusted with brilliant glazes, and the
ridges of stone between the pieces were gilt, so that it resembled jewels
set in gold. An easy imitation of this was by painting the hollows
and ridges, and the crossing lines of the setting soon look like a net
over the capital. We are at once reminded of the "net work" on the
capitals of Solomon, and see in these columns their prototype.</p>

<p>This taste for inlaying was carried to great lengths on the flat walls.
The patterns were incrusted with coloured glazes, and birds and fishes
were painted on whole pieces and let into the blocks; hieroglyphs
were elaborately carved in hard stones and fixed in the hollowed
forms, black granite, obsidian, and quartzite in white limestone, and
alabaster in red granite. The many fragments of steles which have
come from here already, and which I have found, appear to show a
custom of placing one stele--with the usual adoration of the sun by
the king and queen--in each of the great halls of the palace and temple.
These steles are in hard limestone, alabaster, red granite, and
black granite. I have found more steles on the rocks on both sides of
the Nile, and have seen in all eight on the eastern and three on the
western cliffs.</p>

<p>The history of this site, and of the religious revolutions, is somewhat
clearer than before. Khuenaten came to the throne as a minor;
for in his sixth year he had only one child, and in his eighth year only
two, as we learn from the steles, suggesting that he was not married
till his fifth year apparently. On his marriage he changed his name
from Amenhotep IV (which occurs on a papyrus from Gurob in his
<a name="p108" id="p108"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 108</span>
fifth) to Khuenaten (which we find here in the sixth). A scarab
which I got last year in Cairo shows Amenhotep (with Amen erased
subsequently) adoring the cartouches of the Aten, settling his identity
with Khuenaten. In a quarry here is the name of his mother, Queen
Thii, without any king; so she was probably regent during his minority,
and started this capital here herself.</p>

<p>The character of the man, and the real objects of his revolution in
religion and art, are greatly cleared by our now being able to see him
as in the flesh. By an inexplicable chance, there was lying on the
ground, among some stones, a plaster cast taken from his face immediately
after his death for the use of the sculptors of his funeral furniture;
with it were the spoilt rough blocks of granite <i>ushabtis</i> for his
tomb. The cast is in almost perfect condition, and we can now really
study his face, which is full of character. There is no trace of passion
in it, but a philosophical calm with great obstinacy and impracticability.
He was no vigorous fanatic, but rather a high bred theorist
and reformer: not a Cromwell but a Mill. An interesting historical
study awaits us here from his physiognomy and his reforms. No such
cast remains of any other personage in ancient history.</p>

<p>According to one view, he was followed successively by four kings,
Ra saa ka khepru, Tut ankhamen, Ai, and Horemheb, in peaceable
succession. But of late it has been thought that the last three were
rival kings at Thebes; and that they upheld Amen in rivalry to
Khuenaten and his successor, who were cut very short in their reigns.
Nothing here supports the latter view. A great number of moulds for
making pottery rings are found here in factories; and those of Tut
ankhamen are as common and as varied as of Khuenaten, showing
that he was an important ruler here for a considerable time. Of Ai
rings are occasionally found here, as also of Horemheb, who has left a
block of sculpture with his cartouche in the temple of Aten. So it is
certain that he actually upheld the worship of Aten early in his reign,
and added to the buildings here, far from being a destructive rival
overthrowing this place from Thebes. Afterwards he re-established
Amen (as I got a scarab of his in Cairo, "establishing the temple of
Amen"), and he removed the blocks of stone wholesale from here to
build with at Thebes. Later than Horemheb there is not a trace
here; Seti and Ramessu are absolutely unknown in this site, showing
that it was stripped of stone and deserted before the XIX dynasty.
Hence, about two generations, from 1400 to 1340 B.C., are the extreme
limits of date for everything found here. The masonry was re-used at
Thebes, Memphis, and other places where the name of Khuenaten has
been found.</p>

<a name="p109" id="p109"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 109</span>

<p>The manufactures of this place were not extensive--glass and glazes
were the main industries; and the objects so common at Gurob (metal
tools, spindles, thread, weights, and marks on the pottery) are all rare
here. The furnace and the details of making the coloured blue and
green frits, have been found. Pottery moulds for making the pendants
of fruits, leaves, animals, etc., are abundant in the factories; and a
great variety of patterned "Phoenician" glass vases are found, but
only in fragments.</p>

<p>The cuneiform tablets discovered here were all in store rooms outside
the palace; they were placed by the house of the Babylonian
scribe, which was localised by our finding the waste pieces of his spoilt
tablets in rubbish holes. A large quantity of fragments are found of
the Aegean pottery, like that of the early period at Mykenae and
Ialysos. This is completely in accord with what I found at Gurob,
but with more variety in form. The Phoenician pottery which I
found at Lachish is also found here, so we now have a firm dating for
all these styles. The connexion between the naturalistic work of these
frescoes and the fresco of Tiryns and the gold cups of Vaphio is
obvious; and it seems possible that Greece may have started Khuenaten
in his new views of style, which he carried out so fully by his
native artists. The similarity of the geometrical pattern columns to
the sculptures of the Mykenae period is striking; hitherto such Egyptian
decoration was only known in colour, and not in relief. We have
yet a great deal to learn as to the influences between Greece and
Egypt, but this place has helped to open our eyes."--W.M. FLINDERS
PETRIE in <i>Academy</i>, April 9.</p>
<br>

<p>CUNEIFORM TABLETS.--Prof. Sayce while in Egypt spent several days at
Tel el-Amarna with Mr. Petrie, and examined the fragments of cuneiform
tablets which he has discovered there. Among them are portions
of letters from the governors of Musikhuna, in Palestine, and Gebal,
in Phœnicia. The most interesting were some lexical fragments. One
or two of these formed part of a sort of comparative dictionary of three
(or perhaps five) different languages, one of them of course being
Babylonian, in which the words of the other languages are explained
at length. The work seems to have been compiled by "order of the
King of Egypt." Another work was a dictionary of Sumerian and
Babylonian, in which the pronunciation of the Sumerian is given as
well as their ideographic representation. Thus the Babylonian <i>risápu</i>
and <i>di</i> <i>kate</i> are stated to be the equivalents not only of the ideographic
<i>gaz-gaz</i>, but also of the phonetically written <i>ga-az-ga-az</i>. This
confirms the views of Professors Sayce and Oppert, expressed long
<a name="p110" id="p110"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 110</span>
ago, as to the comparatively late date at which <i>Accado-Sumerian</i>
ceased to be a spoken language.--<i>Academy</i>, May 14.</p>
<br>

<p>TOMB OF KHUENATEN OR AMENOPHIS IV.--Prof. Sayce writes to the <i>Academy</i>
of Feb. 27. I have been spending a few days at Tel el-Amarna.
Mr. Flinders Petrie is excavating the ruins of the old city of Khuenaten,
while M. Alexandre, on behalf of the Gizeh Museum, has spent
the summer and autumn among the tombs of Tel el-Amarna, and his
labours have been rewarded by some important discoveries. At the
entrance to one of the tombs, for instance, he has found stelae of the
usual tombstone shape let into the wall like the dedication tablets of
Greek and Roman times. The removal of the sand from the foot of
the great stela of Khuenaten, first discovered by Prisse d'Avennes,
has brought to light a most interesting text. This describes the distance
of the stelae erected by the Pharaoh one from the other, and
thus defines the limits of the territory belonging to the city which he
built.</p>

<p>But M. Alexandre's crowning discovery--a discovery which is one
of the most important made in Egypt in recent years--did not take
place until December 30. It was nothing less than the discovery of
the tomb of Khuenaten himself. The tomb is well concealed, and is
at a great distance from the river and the ruins of the old city. Midway
between the northern and the southern tombs of Tel el-Amarna,
in the amphitheatre of cliffs to the east of the ancient town, are two
ravines, more than three miles from the mouth of one of them, towards
the head of a small valley is the tomb. It resembles the famous
"Tombs of the Kings" at Thebes, being in the form of a subterranean
passage cut in the rock, and sloping downwards at an acute angle to
a distance of more than 100 metres. In front of the entrance is a
double flight to steps also cut out of the rock, with a slide for the
mummy between them. After entering the passage of the tomb, which
is broad and lofty, we pass on the right another long passage, probably
intended for the queen, but never finished. Soon afterwards we come
to a chamber, also on the right, which serves as an antechamber to
another within. The walls of both chambers have been covered with
stucco, and embellished with hieroglyphs and sculptures. Among
the latter are figures of prisoners from Ethiopia and Syria, of the solar
disk, and of female mourners who weep and throw dust on their
heads. From the inscriptions we learn that the two chambers were
the burial-place of Khuenaten's daughter Aten-mert, who must consequently
have died before him. It further follows that Ra-si-aa-ka,
Aten-mert's husband, who received the titles of royalty in consequence
of his marriage, must have been coregent with Khuenaten.</p>

<a name="p111" id="p111"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 111</span>

<p>Khuenaten himself was buried in a large square-columned hall at
the extreme end of the tomb. Fragments of his granite sarcophagus
have been found there by M. Alexandre, as well as pieces of the exquisitely
fine mummy cloth in which his body was wrapped. At the
entrance to the tomb M. Alexandre also picked up broken <i>ushebtis</i>,
upon which the cartouches of Khuenaten are inscribed. Before the
Pharaoh had been properly entombed it would seem that his enemies
broke into his last resting-place, destroyed his sarcophagus, tore the
wrappings of his mummy to shreds, and effaced the name and image
of his god wherever it was engraved upon the wall. The only finished
portions of the tomb are the chambers in which his daughter was
buried. Elsewhere the tomb is in the same condition as the majority
of the tombs of his adherents. The walls have never been covered
with stucco, much less painted or sculptured, and even the columns
of the magnificent hall in which his sarcophagus was placed remains
rough-hewn. It is clear that the king died suddenly, and that he was
buried in haste on the morning of a revolution. His followers may
have made a stand against their enemies for a few months, but it is
difficult to believe from the state in which the tomb has been found
that they can have done so for a longer time. Very shortly after
Khuen-Aten's death his city must have been destoyed, never to be
inhabited again.</p>

<p>Mr. Petrie in a letter to the <i>Academy</i> says: "It has long been
known that the Arabs had obtained access to the tomb of the remarkable
founder of Tel el-Amarna; the heart scarab of Khuenaten was
sold two or three years ago at Luxor, and the jewellery of Neferti-iti,
his queen, a year or two before that."</p>

<p>The entrance is like that of the tomb of Seti I at Thebes; but the
sloping passage is about half the length of that.--<i>Academy</i>, Feb. 6.</p>
<br>

<p>COLLECTION IN LONDON.--The collections of sculpture, painting, faience,
etc., which Mr. Flinders Petrie brought back from his excavations last
winter at Tel el-Amarna have been placed on view at 4 Oxford-mansion,
Oxford-circus, W. Their special interest is that they reveal an
hitherto unknown form of art, remarkable both for its originality and
for its spirited rendering of natural objects. The resemblance to some
of the finest objects of Mycenaean work is very striking. The exhibition
remained open until October 15.--<i>Academy</i>, Sept. 24.</p>

<h3>ETHIOPIA.</h3>
<br>

<p>NORTHERN ETBAI.--EXPEDITION TO THE NORTHERN ETBAI.--A recent scientific
expedition to northern Etbai or northern Aethiopia, by the order
<a name="p112" id="p112"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 112</span>
of the Khedive, is the subject of a very interesting paper by Ernest A.
Floyer, in the <i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</i> for October.</p>

<p>The chief investigation of the expedition was devoted to the remains
of certain large mining stations which proved to be doubly interesting,
as giving evidence of two distinct periods of the mining industry.</p>

<p>Mines have been opened over almost the entire surface, and the remains
of numerous towns mark the dwelling places of the miners.</p>

<p>Not only in the mines is found evidence of two methods, one very
ancient and another less ancient; but in the settlements above were
discovered remains of Ptolemaic construction, together with the stone
huts of a race probably aboriginal, and preceding or contemporaneous
with but not unknown to the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>The Ptolemaic miner seem to have employed the ancient methods
to a great extent, so that it would seem that there could never have
been any complete cessation of mining for a very long period.</p>

<p>The miners of Rameses' time, too, used methods of great antiquity.
In the Wadi Abba stands a rock temple with hieroglyphic inscriptions
stating that Sethos, father of Rameses the Great, had discovered gold
mines in this region. Golenischeff believes this temple to have been
erected by the Ptolemies. At the mines of Sighait is an hieroglyphic
inscription recording the visit of a royal scribe and a mine inspector.
This is faintly inscribed on the face of a steep rock. At the emerald
mines of Sikait may be seen a number of Greek dedications over
rock-cut temples. Near the Wadi Khashat, where topazes are found,
there stands a square enclosure, the platform of a temple, and numerous
ruined structures of apparent Greek origin. It would appear
from these remains that the Ptolemies examined all of the ancient
mines and reopened a certain number--here they erected their
temples, houses and barracks for slaves, here they constructed high
roads for their carts and oxen, with caravan service, and post houses
built at intervals.</p>

<p>Beside these Ptolemaic ruins are found some traces of the prehistoric
miners, and in a few cases as at the mines of the Um Roos
these exist alone. The most important traces are the stone huts built
of large stones in two lines, and of uniform irregularity. In connection
with these huts there is not a single mark or inscription of any
kind which might lead to a solution of the problem with regard to
their origin.</p>

<p>Their implements, quantities of which are found at Um Roos were
as crude as their abodes, in fact the use of some of them cannot be determined.
The mines, though extensive, are little more than burrows,
and in a few cases it is not known for what mineral they were
<a name="p113" id="p113"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 113</span>
excavated. The writer, after dismissing the Æthiopians, the Kushites
and the ancient Egyptians, as the probable pre-Ptolemaic miners,
suggests that the Etbai was peopled by a negroid tribe of natural
miners, the possible ancestors of the copper miners in the mountains
north of Kordofan.</p>

<p>Near the Wadi Sikait, not far from the temples with Greek inscriptions
already referred to, is a fine building of apparently later date,
and supposed by the writer to have been a church from its construction,
for the mines were worked steadily during the third and fourth
centuries of the Christian era. The structure has no roof over the
main portion, but what was apparently an apse still retains its roof of
long slabs of schist. The body is filled with fallen slabs. The walls
show a side window and several niches, which features suggested a
Christian church.</p>

<h3>ALGERIA AND TUNISIA.</h3>
<br>

<p>M. René de la Blanchère in making, to the <i>Acad. des Inscriptions</i>, his
report on the excavations and discoveries in Tunisia and Algeria
during 1891, calls attention to the new organization of the archæological
administration of this region. Up to the present time Tunisia
and Algeria had separate organizations, but the following arrangement
has now gone into effect: M. de la Blanchère is delegate of Public Instruction
and Fine Arts, in Algeria and Tunisia, and the mission
under him is at present composed of Μ.Μ. Doublet, inspector of
antiquities in the Regency; Pradère, conservator of the Museum of
Bardo; Wood, attaché at the same museum; Gauckler, historical
student, and Marye: it is quite distinct from the local administrations.
Although it supplies the greater number of the agents of the Bey's
service of antiquities, which it created, it has no connection with its
administration any more than with that of similar organizations in
Algeria, such as that of historical monuments. Its object is: (1) to
keep the Committee of Historic works (of Algeria and Tunisia)
informed of all that happens in Africa in the domain of archæology,
to transmit to it any documents and to make researches regarding
necessary work; (2) to carry on three important publications, two of
which have already been partly published; the <i>Collections du Musée
Alaoui, the Musées et collections archéologiques de l'Algérie</i>, and the
<i>Catalogue général des musées de l'Afrique française</i>; (3) to hold itself at the
disposal of the French ministry and the local authorities for any
work deemed necessary, excavations, organization of museums, enterprises
of learned societies, explorations, etc. The head of the mission,
being a delegate of the ministry, has the right to oversee the Tunisian
<a name="p114" id="p114"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 114</span>
service of antiquities, and has also for both Algeria and Tunisia the
permanent inspection of libraries and museums.</p>

<p>By means of this central organization, all the desiderata for African
archæology are obtained, and the best methods are put in practice for
excavations, the organization of museums, and the publication of
antiquities.</p>
<br><br>



<h3>TUNISIA.</h3>
<br>

<p>M. de la Blanchère reports that in 1891 the most urgent need in
Tunisia was the classification of monuments that should be preserved.
The operation is being carried on under the direction of M. Doublet;
enquiry was opened in regard to about 150 monuments, nearly all of
great importance, of which 27 are already classified. No excavations
were undertaken by the service of antiquities, its funds being all
employed on finishing the Bardo museum. It has, however, overseen
or authorized the following enterprises, the most important of which
will be found described in their alphabetical order: Sfaks; Sousse;
Henchir Maatria; Dougga; Teboursouk; Henchir Tinah; Maktar.</p>
<br>

<p>CARTHAGE.--M. do Vogüé has communicated to the <i>Acad. des Ins.</i>
(March 18) a report on the continuation of Father Delattre's excavations
at Carthage, which go on giving interesting results which will be
fully described in a publication by the explorer himself. At another
point a funerary inscription was found of an iron caster. This is the
first time the profession is mentioned in Carthaginian texts, which had
hitherto mentioned only gold and bronze casters. Of course there was
no casting of iron at that time, but only working of the metal.--<i>Revue
arch.</i> 1892, II, p. 254.</p>
<br>

<p>TERRACOTTA MOULDS.--M. Héron de Villefosse communicated to the
<i>Acad. des Inscr.</i> (Nov. 11,) the photographs of seventy-two moulds for
intaglios, in terracotta, selected from a collection of over three hundred
which were found in the lower part of Carthage, between the hill of
St. Louis and the sea. They were all executed in antiquity. There
are coin, types, a head of Herakles, similar to that of some silver coins
attributed to Jugurtha, the fronting head of Silenus of the coins of
Kyzikos, the galley of the coins of Sidon, etc., all of the purest Greek
style. There are also some female heads, recalling Greek Sicilian
coins; standing figures; an Athena, a Pan, a Hermes fastening his
heel-pieces, a Marsyas, an amazon, a nude woman fastening her sandal,
recalling coins of Larissa in Thessaly; some of groups, a man overthrown
by a lion, a lion devouring a horse, a man standing and
killing a kneeling woman, an episode of the contest of Achilles and
Penthesilea; finally some purely Egyptian types, such as scarabs
<a name="p115" id="p115"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 115</span>
with royal cartouches. This collection of moulds was probably made
by a manufacturer with the purpose of reproducing them.--<i>Rev.
Critique</i>, 1892, No. 47.</p>
<br>

<p>CHEMTOU-SIMITHU.--Excavations have been carried on at this site by
M. Toutain: they were continued, thanks to a subvention from the
<i>Acad. des Inscriptions</i>. In a letter to the Academy dated June 16, M.
Geffroy gives an account of what had been discovered up to date.
Nearly the whole of the ancient theatre was discovered in a few weeks.
In the space occupied by the orchestra was a mosaic, with all the
shades of Numidian marble, nine metres in diameter. These are
interesting peculiarities in the construction and arrangement of the
theatre. It is neither adossed to a hill nor completely isolated: the
lower part of the hemicycle of steps which was completely buried, is
well preserved. M. Toutain had commenced researches in two necropoli
of the city hoping to find tombs and epitaphs of the freedmen and
slaves employed in the neighbouring quarries. He had begun the
excavation of a large building, perhaps a basilica or a curia, which
appears to be about 40 metres long.</p>

<p>In a letter to the <i>Académie</i>, dated October 16, M. Toutain gives information
of further discoveries, principally in the theatre and forum.
A square was discovered 20 met. wide by 25 met. long, paved with
large slabs of granite of greenish blue schist. It is situated in the
midst of the ruins of several important monuments, notably a temple
and a basilica, and is certainly the forum of Simithu. It is bounded
on the south by a monumental exædra whose substructions of cut
stone are still in place, and whose architectural decoration can be
reconstructed by means of the bases, fragments, columns, capitals, and
pieces of cornice which have come to light. Toward the north the
forum is bounded by two structures separated by a narrow paved
street.</p>

<p>A mile-stone found is important, as containing the name of Emperor
Galerius, and dating from the short period when, after the abdication of
Diocletian and Maximianus, Hercules, Constantius Chlorus, and
Galerius were Augusti (May 1, 305, to July 25, 306). It has also a
topographic interest as belonging to the cross-road from <i>Thuburbo
majus</i> to Tunis or Carthage, passing by Onellana and Uthina. M.
Toutain has traced a system of bars, basins and cisterns, to supply
with rain water a small Roman city, whose ruins are now called Bab-
Khaled. It would appear as if the public buildings of the city were
inhabited and made over at the Byzantine period.--<i>Revue critique</i>
1892, No. 44; <i>Revue arch.</i>, 1892, II, pp. 260, 266-7; <i>Chron. des arts</i>
1892, No. 34.</p>
<br>
<a name="p116" id="p116"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 116</span>

<p>CHERCHELL.--M. Victor Waille has communicated to the <i>Acad. des
Insc.</i> the first results of excavations on the field of manœuvres at
Cherchell. Captain Hétet and lieutenant Perrin conducted them.
Three mosaic pavements were copied: there was found a dedicatory
inscription to the governor C. Octavius Pudens Cæsius Honoratus, and
some bronzes, among which were the base of a candelabrum and the
handle of a chiseled vase, decorated with a helmeted bust of Roma,
of the Byzantine period. The excavations are especially fruitful in
small objects, pottery, bronzes, coins, etc.--<i>Chron. des arts</i>, 1892,
No. 31; <i>Ami des mon.</i> 1892, p. 250.</p>
<br>

<p>DOUGGA.--The excavations carried on by MM. Denis and Carton,
resulted in the clearing of the temple of Saturn; the discovery of the
dedicatory inscription showing it to have been erected for the safety
of Septimius Severus and Clodius Albinus; the finding of a large
number of native steles; and the clearing of the theatre.</p>
<br>

<p>HADRUMETUM.--A small lead tablet covered on both sides with
inscriptions, has been found in the Roman necropolis. It is a <i>tabella
devotionis</i>, to be compared with others found at Hadrumetum, at
Carthage and in Gaul. On one side is a series of magic names,
accompanied by the figure of a genius with a rooster's head, standing
in a boat and holding a torch, on the other side is an adjuration
addressed to a certain <i>deus pelagicus ærius</i>: infernal maledictions are
called down on the horses and drivers of the green and white factions
of the circus. There was a god or genius named Taraxippos, "the
scarer of horses," as M. Heuzey remarks.--<i>Rev. arch.</i> 1892, II, p. 267.</p>
<br>

<p>MAKTAR.--M. Border exhumed from the mines of the basilica, next
to the amphitheatre, four fragments of an imperial dedicatory inscription,
and a most interesting altar bearing a dedication in eighteen
lines on the occasion of the sacrifice of a bull and a ram for the safety
of an Emperor, whose name is hammered out; M. Doublet conjectures
him to have been Elagabalus.--<i>A.d.M.</i> 1892, p. 109.</p>
<br>

<p>SOUSSE.-In the neo-punic necropolis, on which the camp is situated,
two entire vases and 28 fragments of vases were found, decorated with
painted inscriptions. In the Roman necropolis, along the Kairwan
road, several interesting discoveries were made, among them a
hypogeum containing several frescoes in fair preservation, containing
curious figures and inscriptions, and also some inscriptions on marble
or stucco.--<i>A.d.M.</i> 1892, p. 109.</p>
<br>

<p>TEBOURSOUK.--MM. Denis and Carton have excavated the megalithic
necropolis of Teboursouk, whose tombs are stone circles, with
one or more small dolmens in the centre.--<i>A.d.M.</i> 1892, p. 109.</p>
<br>
<a name="p117" id="p117"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 117</span>


<p>TUNIS.--Hans von Behrs has contributed to the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i> a
report on the museum of the Bardo near Tunis. A summary of it is
given in the <i>Berlin Philologische Wochenschrift</i>, November 19.</p>
<br><br>



<h3>ALGERIA.</h3>
<br>

<p>M. de la Blanchère reports that in Algeria M. Gauckler investigated
in 1891 the provinces of Algiers and Constantine, and spent some time
at Cherchell whose antiquities he studied and partly published alone
or in collaboration with M. de Waille. He planned at the same time
an excavation. M. Marye was charged with the plan for organizing,
for the first time, a collection of mussulman art, of native industrial art,
and of Turkish and Arabic monuments.</p>

<p>The work regarded as most pressing by M. de la Blanchère in 1891
was the publication of African museums. The first series of the <i>collections
du musée Alaoui</i> was almost completed: the <i>musées d'Oran</i> and <i>de
Constantine</i> were in the press, following the <i>musée d'Alger</i> published in
the preceding year. The general catalogue will be drawn up as each
establishment is definitively organized. The first place belongs to the
Bardo museum whose catalogue had already been partly compiled by
M. de la Blanchère. The museum of Oran, under its conservator,
Demaeght, has been finally organized, and occupies a fine building
given by the city. It has been enriched by several additions, notably
the famous inscription of king Masuna. The museum of Constantine
has received among other things, the results of an interesting excavation
made at Collo, especially some curious vases with female
silhouettes. The museum of the Bardo can, however, never be
rivalled by any of the museums of Algeria. The immense palace is
already nearly full, although the museum in 1891 was but four years
old. The large hall is full, with its nine large cases; there are about
500 square metres of mosaics, 50 statues of large fragments, about
1200 inscriptions, and a multitude of small objects.</p>
<br>

<p>TIPASA.--The local curate, M. l'Abbé Saint-Gérand, has made some
important excavations in an early Christian church. He found that
the altar was placed at the end opposite the apse on a kind of platform
or <i>béma</i> attached to the wall. Several inscriptions were found
set into the mosaic pavement. One is the epitaph of Alexander, a
bishop of Tipasa, another the dedication of the construction by him.
To this bishop is attributed the merit of grouping about the altar the
tombs of certain "righteous ancients," <i>justi priores</i>, by whom are
undoubtedly meant his predecessors in the Episcopacy.--<i>Chron. des
arts</i>, 1892, No. 14.</p>

<a name="p118" id="p118"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 118</span>

<p>Professor Gsell assisted in the excavations above described and
further details in a communication to the <i>Académie des Inscriptions</i>.
The building mentioned was a funerary chapel built to the
east of Tipasa by Bishop Alexander to contain the tombs of his predecessors.
Near by a Christian sarcophagus was found with reliefs of
Christ giving the law, Moses striking the rock and other subjects.</p>

<p>In the same locality is the basilica of Saint Salsa erected over her
tomb. Built in the fourth century, it was decorated in the middle of
the fifth by Potentius, probably a bishop; and enlarged in the second
half of the sixth. It was still an object of veneration in the seventh
century.--<i>Chron. des arts</i>, 1892, No. 28.</p>

<h2>ASIA.</h2>
<br>

<h3>HINDUSTAN.</h3>
<br>

<p>MUHAMMADAN COINS.--Mr. S. Lane-Poole has completed his "Catalogue
of the Coins of the Mogul Emperors of Hindustan in the British
Museum," dating from 1525, the invasion of Buber, to the establishment
of British currency in 1835.</p>

<p>It describes over 1400 coins, chiefly gold and silver, of this splendid
coinage. "In his introduction Mr. Lane-Poole deals with various
historical, geographical, and other problems suggested by the coinage,
and with difficulties of classification presented by the early imitative
issues of the East India company and the French compagnie des Indes."
This volume, the fourteenth, completes the cataloguing of all the
Muhammadan coins in the museum.--<i>Journal Royal Asiatic Society</i>
1892, p. 425.</p>
<br>

<p>INDIAN NUMISMATICS.--Mr. Rodgers, Honorary Numismatist to the
government of India, has finished his "Catalogue of the Coins with
Persian or Arabic inscriptions in the Lahore museum," and practically
finished his "Catalogue of the Coins in the Calcutta museum." His
own immense collection has now been purchased by the Punjãb
government, and he has nearly completed his catalogue of that.</p>

<p>These catalogues will be of very great importance alike for the
numismatic and for the modern history of India.--<i>Journ. Royal
Asiatic Society</i>, 1892, p. 425.</p>
<br>

<p>NEW VARIETY OF MAURYA INSCRIPTIONS.--Prof. Buhler has made a
very careful study of impressions of nine votive inscriptions from the
relic-caskets discovered by Mr. Rea in the ruined stupa of Bhattiprolu
in the Kistna District (Madras). He has made out their contents, and
has arrived at the conclusion that they are written in a new variety
of the Southern Maurya or Làt alphabet. Twenty-three letters of
<a name="p119" id="p119"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 119</span>
these inscriptions agree exactly with those ordinarily used in the
edicts of Asoka which have long been held to belong to the
first attempts of the Hindus in the art of writing. Four letters
are entirely unusual, while the lingual l is introduced, which
does not occur in Asoka's inscriptions. Further peculiarities
are presented in the notation of the medial and final vowels. The
appearance of the letters would indicate that the Bhattiprolu inscriptions
probably belong to a period only a few decades later than that of
Asoka's edicts. By a comparison of these incriptions with Asoka's
edicts, and with the inscriptions of Nâuâgleât, Hathegumplia, Bharhut
and Triana, it becomes evident that they hold an intermediate position
between the two sets, but are much more nearly related to those of
the third century B.C. than those of the second. If this be true, the
date of the Bhattiprolu inscription cannot be placed later than 200
B.C., and the inscriptions themselves prove that several distinct
varieties of the Southern Maurya alphabet existed during the third
century, B.C.</p>

<p>This fact would remove one of the strongest arguments in favor of
the theory that writing was introduced into India during the rule of
the Maurya dynasty--<i>i.e.</i>, the absence of local sorts of letters in which
the edicts of Asoka were written in places widely separated, for this
may be explained by a desire to imitate as closely as possible the
character of the original edict.</p>

<p>If then the Bhattiprolu inscriptions show a system of characters
radically different from those of Asoka's edicts and at the same time
in all probability coeval with them a strong point is gained for
the side of those who are of the opinion that the introduction of
writing into India took place centuries before the accession of the
Maurya Dynasty. It is a curious fact that of all the anomalous letters
in the Bhattiprolu alphabet not one bears any trace to the later
alphabets of India, all the characters of which are derived from
those of Southern Maurya. The language of these inscriptions is a
Prakrit dialect and is closely connected with the literary Pali.--<i>Journ.
Royal Asiatic Society</i>, 1892, p. 602.</p>
<br>

<p>THE INDIAN HELL.--In a number of the <i>Journal Asiatique</i> (Sept., Oct.,
'92), M. Léon Feer publishes an article entitled "<i>L'Enfer Indien</i>,"
in which he confines himself to the Buddhist hells, leaving the Brahmanic
hells for another study. He avails himself of all previously
printed matter and adds new material. His object is to group together
and classify all the ideas on infernal punishments, on the crimes
for which they are inflicted and their duration. There are separate
chapters on: (1) the name and number of hells; (2) the eight large
<a name="p120" id="p120"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 120</span>
hot hells; (3) the attribution of the hells to distinct crimes; (4) the
small hells. There are many questions in connection with them
which he leaves unsolved. Then come the cold hells: (1) the
Chinese hells; (2) Southern hells; (3) the number and names of
the cold hells (of both north and south); (4) the duration of one's
dwelling in the various hells; (5) on the non-existence of the cold
hells; (6) on the period of time spent in all the hells, etc. The main
conclusions are, that: All Buddhists recognize eight burning hells,
with ascending intensity, surrounded by secondary hells of numbers
varying from four to sixteen. Beside those there are eight cold hells,
but only in the North, their names being considered in the South as
expressing merely the different periods of sojourn in the eighth hell.
The number of hells is at least 12, at most 32.</p>
<br>

<p>ARCHÆOLOGICAL SURVEY.--The second volume of the new series of
the Archaæological Survey of India is devoted to a catalogue of the
antiquities and inscriptions in the North-Western Provinces and
Oudh, compiled by Dr. A. Fuhrer. No part of India, not even the
Panjab, is so crowded with historic spots, associated not only with
the life and teaching of Buddha, and with the Hindu theogony, but
also with the Muhammadan conquest. Most of the ground has
already been worked over by Sir A. Cunningham and his assistants; but
there are square miles of ruined mounds still almost untouched. We
continually hear of finds of ancient coins made by peasants during
the rainy season; but the author is careful to point out that what is
now wanted is systematic exploration, like that of Mr. Petrie in
Egypt. The present volume is based rather upon printed documents
than upon original research, though it shows everywhere the traces of
personal knowledge. Its object is to carry out the orders of the
Government, by placing on record a catalogue of the existing monuments,
classified according to their archæological importance, their
state of repair, and their custody. It is arranged in the order of
administrative divisions and districts; but copious indices enable the
student to bring together any particular line of investigation.--<i>Academy</i>,
September.</p>
<br>

<p>A HISTORICAL DOCUMENT.--Dr. M. Aurel Stein, principal of the Oriental
College at Lahore, has now ready for publication the first volume
of his critical edition of the Rajatarangini, or Chronicles of the Kings
of Kashmir, upon which he has been engaged for some years. This
work, which was written by the poet Kalhana in the middle of the
twelfth century, is of special interest as being almost the sole example
of historical literature in Sanskrit. Hitherto it has only been known</p>

<p>[Pages 121 and 122 are missing.]</p>

<a name="p123" id="p123"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 123</span>

<p>Near the stûpa is the site of the ancient village and fort; long
ridges of earth, in form of a square, mark the position of the walls;
within these, various articles have been turned up, large bricks, broken
sepulchral urns and grain jars, together with beads of various material
and Buddhist lead coins, both round and square; they bear the lion
and the dugoba, emblems of the Andhra dynasty. The inscriptions
of some are preserved.</p>
<br>

<p>II. GHANTASALA.--At Ghantasala is a mound 112 feet in diameter and
23 feet in height; the excavations here disclosed the remains of a
stûpa from which the complete plan was determined. In the centre
is a solid cube of brick work 10 feet square, enclosed in a chamber 19
feet square with walls over 3 feet in thickness; outside this is a circular
wall 3 ft. 6 inches thick, 55 feet 10 inches in diameter, this is enclosed
in another circular brick wall 18 feet 3 inches thick, with a diameter
of 111 feet; this was the main outer wall of the structure, the exterior
surface bore a <i>chunam</i> facing. About the base is a raised procession
path 5 feet 7 in. broad, and 4 feet 6 in. high, a projection is found at
each of the cardinal points. The inmost squares are connected by
walls 2 feet 4 in. thick, running parallel to these sides from the centre
and corners, the cells formed by the intersections of these walls are
packed with mud.</p>

<p>The fact that the main walls, <i>i.e.</i>, those of the squares and circles, are
thicker than the others may indicate that they were carried up to
form stories, or they may have been simply to strengthen the dome, if
the exterior wall was carried up in that form. Further excavations in
the mound discovered a marble slab carved with the Supada, a piece
of a carved top rail panel and a number of carved slabs.</p>

<p>When the brick work was excavated a well 6 inches square filled
with earth was found under 3 feet of solid brick work. Among the
debris, at the top, were found pieces of a broken <i>chatti</i>, and a number
of small articles, beads and a coin, which it had probably contained.
Just below these was a <i>chatti</i> of red earthenware, 4-1/2 in. in diameter,
with a semi-circular lid, filled with black earth. Within this was a
glazed <i>chatti</i> 2-1/4 in. in diameter, and 1-3/4 in. in height. It contained
numerous leads, bits of bone, small pearls, bits of gold leaf and small
pieces of mineral.</p>

<p>A number of marble sculptures have been removed from the
stûpa of Ghantasala, and are now in the village. Among them are
several pieces carved with lotus flowers, and other ornaments and
inscriptions, square and circular moulded vases, a circular base
carved with horses, elephants and other animals, an umbrella, a panel
with rail and figures, and two carved slabs. Other remains found in
<a name="p124" id="p124"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 124</span>
and near Ghantasala are an "ancient brass <i>dipa</i>, with a Telugu inscription
and a small brass image of Siva" now in the temple, a
"small <i>chakra</i> and a <i>trisula</i>, each with pillar base." Brick walls and
brick debris are found all about the neighborhood, but so demolished
as to make it impossible to determine what the buildings were.</p>
<br>

<p>III. BHATTIPROLU.--On the report in the stûpa of Bhattiprolu, a former
letter is referred to in which an account is given of certain inscribed
caskets, and other relics found in the centre of the dome some time
before. The reports continue with the account of further excavations
by means of trenches. Those about the exterior discovered an
unbroken procession path at the small east quadrant, the face of the
dome too at this point is intact to a height of over 5 ft. In the
trenches at the north side there was found "two pieces of a marble
umbrella, having a curve of a radius of 1 foot 6 in., a small piece of
a pilaster base from a slab, a pilaster capital with horses and riders,
and the half of what had been a large slab carved with the lower
portion of a draped figure.</p>

<p>At some distance from the basement, or procession path, the
remains of six marble bases of the rail were found standing in position--they
are 1 ft. 11., by 12 in., by 1 ft. 10 in., in height, spaced by a
distance of 1 ft. 7 in. in each, they are sunk 1 ft. 6 in. below the brick
floor, and rest on a broad marble slab.</p>

<p>A large number of ancient sites and mounds were examined in the
neighborhood of Repalle. At <i>Anantaiarum, Buddhâní, Chandavôlu</i>
and <i>Puapuâ</i>. Considerable surface has been excavated for various
purposes; the earth, a kind of black mud, is found to be thickly
mixed with broken pottery and bones of animals; occasionally a pillar
or other building stone is turned up. At Môrakûru, copper, lead
and rarely gold and silver coins are found mixed with the broken
pottery.</p>

<p>At <i>Krudarnudi, Maudura, Mûlpûrn</i> and <i>Periarli</i>, mounds were
examined, the earth was found to consist of black mud mixed with
pottery and ashes. The mounds differ only in extent, and portions
of several have been removed.</p>
<br>

<p>BHATTIPROLU.--A BUDDHIST STUPA.--Mr. Rea during last season examined
the remains of a stûpa at Bhattiprolu in the Kistna district, the
marble casing of which had been used by the Canal engineers; and in
it he has made discoveries of very considerable interest.</p>

<p>He found the stûpa had been a solid brick building 132 feet in
diameter, surrounded by a procession path about eight feet wide. It
must thus have been of very nearly the dimensions of the Amarāvati
stûpa. Fragments or chips only of the outer casing of marble
<a name="p125" id="p125"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 125</span>
were found in the area he excavated. When the dome and portions
of the drum had been previously demolished for the materials,
inside the dome there was found "a casket made of six small slabs
of stone dove-tailed into one another, measuring about 2-1/2 feet by
1-1/2 by 1 foot; inside this was a clay <i>chatti</i> containing a neat soap-stone
casket, which enclosed a crystal phial. In this latter was a
pearl, a few little bits of gold leaf, and some ashes." Mr. Rea considered
that there might still be another deposit of relics; and having
discovered the centre of the original brickwork, he found there a shaft
or well 9-1/2 inches in diameter filled with earth, which went down about
15 feet. Following this he found at one side near the bottom a stone
box about 11 inches by 8 and 5 inches deep, with an inscription round
the upper lip. Inside was a small globular blackstone relic casket,
two small hemipsherical metal cups a little over an inch in diameter,
with a gold bead on the apex of one, and the bead (fallen out) of the
other; another small bead, two double pearls, also four gold lotus
flowers 1.2 inch in diameter, two <i>trisulas</i> in thin plates 1.2 by 1 inch,
seven triangular bits of gold, a single and a double gold bead--the
weight of these gold articles being about 148 grains. There was also
a hexagonal crystal 2.56 inches long by 0.88 inch in diameter, pierced
along the axis, and with an inscription lightly traced on the sides.
The stone relic casket measures 4-1/2 inches each way, the lid fitting on
with a groove, and it contained a cylindric crystal phial 2-1/2 inches in
diameter and 1-1/4 inches high, moulded on the sides and flat on top and
bottom; the lid fitted in the same way as that of the casket. Inside
was a flattish piece of bone--possibly of the skull--and under the
phial were nine small lotus flowers in gold leaf; six gold beads and
eight small ones; four small lotus flowers of thin copper; nineteen
small pierced pearls; one bluish crystal bead; and twenty-four
small coins in a light coloured metal, possibly brass, smooth on one
side and with lotus flowers, <i>trisulas</i>, feet, etc., on the obverse. These
had been arranged on the bottom and attached in the form of a
<i>svastika</i>.</p>

<p>Two and a half feet below this was a second deposit on the opposite
or north side of the shaft. The central area of the cover, in this case,
has an inscription in nineteen lines with two lines round it--the letters
being filled in with white. In the lower stone was a receptacle 6-1/4 inches
deep, by 7-1/2 in diameter, having a raised rim 1-1/2 inches broad, bearing
another inscription of two lines on the upper surface--the letters also
filled in with lime. The cavity was nearly filled with earth, and contained
a phial 1-5/8 inches in diameter and 2-3/4 inches high, with a lid
moulded like a <i>dagoba</i>. The phial and lid were lying separate, and
<a name="p126" id="p126"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 126</span>
there was no sign of a relic. Mixed with the earth were 164 lotus leaves
and buds, two circular flowers, a trisula and a three-armed figure like a
<i>svastika</i>, all in gold leaf, two gold stems for lotus flowers, six gold
beads, and a small gold ring--weighing, collectively, about 310 grains;
also two pearls, a garnet, six coral beads, a bluish, flat, oval bead, a
white crystal bead, two greenish, flat, six-sided crystal drops, a
number of bits of corroded copper leaf in the shape of lotus flowers, a
minute umbrella, and some folded pieces about 2 inches by 1-3/8,
showing traces of letters or symbols pricked upon them with a metal
point, but too corroded to permit of unfolding or decipherment.</p>

<p>Next, at a slightly lower level on the east side of the shaft, he came
upon a third black stone cover, with an inscription of eight lines cut
on the under surface in a sunk, circular area in the centre. The
lower stone again bears an inscription round the rim of the cavity in
one line--the letters being whitened. The receptacle was 5-3/4 inches
deep, 7-1/2 wide at the top, and 5 at the bottom. It was also nearly
filled with earth, and contained a crystal phial similar to that in the
second, the lid lying apart; but close to it was the relic casket,
perhaps of chrysolite, less than half an inch each way by three-eighths,
in which is drilled a circular hole 0.28 inch in diameter, closed
by a small, white crystal stopper with hexagonal top. The neck is
covered with gold leaf, and a sheet of the same was fixed outside to
the bottom. This unique casket contains three small pieces of bone.
With it were found a bluish bead 5/8 inch long, a smaller one, and one
of yellow crystal, a small hexagonal crystal drop, slightly yellowish
in colour, a flat one of white crystal, a bone bead, six pearls, thirty-two
seed pearls--all pierced, thirty lotus flowers, a quatrefoil, and a
small figure of gold leaf.</p>

<p>The alphabet of the inscriptions presents features of peculiar
interest, which I leave to be discussed by Prof. Bühler.--Jas. Burgess

<p>GAUΗATI.--ASSAM.--Mr. Joseph Chunder Dutt has reprinted from the
<i>Indian Nation</i> (Calcutta) an account of an archægeological visit to
Gauhati, the ancient capital of Assam. The temples, etc., he describes
mostly date only from the eighteenth century, as is shown by
the inscriptions which he is careful to quote. There are, however,
many ruins of older buildings and fragments of sculpture, which
would perhaps repay more detailed examination. The destruction of
some of these is due to the misdirected activity of British engineers.--<i>Academy</i>,

<p>PANJAB.--REMAINS OF ANCIENT BUDDHIST TEMPLES.--The <i>Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society</i> for October, 1892, contains a note in "Ancient remains
of Temples on the Bannu Frontier," an unfrequented part of the
Panjab. The ruins of two temples stand on a hillock rising from the
Indus. The tradition with regard to them is that the Paridwas
retired here to spend twelve years of exile after being defeated by the
Kerwá. A short distance from these ruins is the site of a third
temple now completely demolished. This temple was completely
demolished. This temple was built of bricks of light pressed (?) clay
about 12x9x3 inches in size. On breaking some of the bricks they
were found to bear distinctly the impression of tree leaves, and
brought under the influence of a petrifying spring which exists not
far from the spot.</p>

<p>The remains are undoubtedly of great antiquity, and appears to
have been Buddhist temples of the tall, conical kind. Their Buddhistic
origin is made certain by the eight-leafed lotus ornaments which
characterize the carvings.</p>
<br>

<h3>THIBET.</h3>

<p>Mr. Rockhill, who made himself so well-known by his first expedition
to Thibet, is at present engaged in a second journey, in the
hope of this time reaching the capital Lhassa.</p>

<p>The Duke of Orleans and his companion have already published
the results of their journey undertaken shortly after Mr. Rockhill's
first.</p>
<br>

<h3>CHINA.</h3>

<p>THE GAME OF WEI-CHI.--At a meeting in Shanghai of the Chinese
Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, M. Volpicelli read a paper on
"The Game of Wei-Chi," the greatest game of the Chinese, especially
with the literary class and ranked by them superior to chess. Like
chess, this game is of a general military and mathematical character,
but is on a much more extensive scale, the board containing 361
places and employing nearly 200 men on a side. All of the men,
however, have the same value and powers.</p>

<p>The object is to command as many places on the board as possible--this
may be done by enclosing empty spaces or by surrounding the
enemy's men. Very close calculation is always essential in order
that a loss in one region may be met by gains in another, thus
employing skillful strategy when the contestants are evenly matched.
The game has come down from great antiquity, being first mentioned
in Chinese writings about B.C. 625. It was in all probability introduced
<a name="p128" id="p128"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 128</span>
by the Babylonian astronomers who were at that time the
instructors of all the East.--<i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</i>, 1892,
p. 421.</p>
<br>

<h3>CENTRAL ASIA.</h3>


<p>EXPEDITION OF M. DUTREUIL DE RHINS.--The <i>Académie des Inscriptions</i>
sent M. Dutreuil de Rhins some time since on an archæological
expedition to Further Asia. Beside the income of the Gamier fund
previously accorded to him for the purpose, it has accorded him a
grant of 30,000 francs. The last news from him was a report.--<i>Chron.
des Arts</i>, 1892, No. 22.</p>
<br>

<p>THE ORKHON INSCRIPTIONS.--We quote from the <i>Times</i> the following
report of two papers read before the Oriental Congress, in the
section of China and the Far East:</p>

<p>"A paper was contributed by Mr. E. Delmar Morgan on 'The
Results of the Russian Archæological Researches in the Basin of the
Orkhon in Mongolia.' Mr. Morgan drew attention to a splendid atlas
of plates presented to the Congress by Dr. Radlof, of St. Petersburg,
containing photographs and facsimiles of inscriptions copied by the
members of the archæological expedition sent by the Imperial Academy
of Sciences to investigate the ruins on the Orkhon. These ruins
comprise (1) the remains of an ancient Uighur town west of the
Orkhon, (2) the ruins of a Mongol palace to the east of that river,
and a large granite monument shattered into pieces. Excavations
were also made of the burial places of the Khans of the Tukiu or
Turks inhabiting this part of Asia previously to the Uighurs, who
drove them out. The earliest inscription dates from 732 A.D.., and
refers to a brother of the Khan of the Tukiu mentioned in Chinese
history. Additional interest attaches to these inscriptions owing to
the fact that some of the characters are identical with those discovered
on the Yenissei. The expedition to which the paper referred visited
the monastery of Erdenitsu, and found there a number of stones with
inscriptions in Mongol, Tibetan, and Persian, brought from the ruins
of a town not far off. These ruins have been identified with Karakoram,
the capital city of the first Khans of the dynasty of Jenghiz
Khan.</p>

<p>"Prof. Donner wished to present to the Congress a publication by
the Société Finno-Ougrienne at Helsingfors, containing inscriptions
from the valley of the Orkhon, brought home by the Finnish Expedition
in 1890. There are three large monuments, the first erected
732 A.D.., by the order of the Chinese Emperor in honour of Kiuèh-Jeghin,
younger brother of the Khan of the Tukiu (Turks). On the
<a name="p129" id="p129"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 129</span>
west side it has an inscription in Chinese, speaking of the relations
between the Tukiu and Chinese. The Tartar historian, Ye-lu-chi, of
the thirteenth century, saw it and gave some phrases from the front of
it. On all the other sides is a long inscription of 70 lines in runic characters,
which cannot be a mere translation of the Chinese because it
numbers about 1400 words, while the Chinese inscription contains
only about 800. The other monument has also a Chinese inscription
on one side, but greatly effaced. On the other sides are runic inscriptions
in 77 lines at least. This monument was erected, by order of the
Chinese Emperor, in honour of Mekilikn (Moguilen), Khan of the
Tukiu, who died 733 A.D.. About two-thirds of its runic inscription
nearly line for line contains the same as the first monument, a circumstance
of importance for the true reading of the text. The third
monument, which has been the largest one, was destroyed by lightning
and shattered into about fifty fragments. It is trilingual--viz.,
Chinese, Uighur, and runic or Yenissei characters. On comparing
the texts they are found to contain many identical words and forms,
proving that the languages were nearly identical. M. Devéria thinks
that this is the memorial stone which the Uighur Khan, 784 A.D..,
placed at the gateway of his palace to record the benefits the Uighurs
had done to the Chinese Empire. Concerning the characters of these
inscriptions they show small modifications. The tomb inscriptions
at Yenissei seem to be the more original; some characters have been
altered in the Tukiu alphabet and also in the third monument, representing
in that way the three several nations--the Tukiu, the Uighurs,
who followed them, and the Hakas, or Khirgiz, at Yenissei. A comparison
of the characters themselves with the alphabets in Asia Minor
shows that about three-fourths of them are identical with the characters
of the Ionian, Phrygian, and Syrian [?]. The other part has
resemblances with the graphic systems of India and Central Asia.
We can now expect that the deciphering of these interesting inscriptions
will soon give us reliable specimens of the oldest Turk dialects."--<i>Academy</i>,
Sept. 17.</p>
<br>

<p>SIMFEROPOL.--At Simferopol Prof. Messelowski has made the most
interesting discovery of a Scythian warrior's grave, dating probably
from about the second or third century. The skeleton lay on its back
facing the east, on the head was a cap with gold ornaments, and little
gold plates were also fixed to portions of the dress. Near the head
stood two amphoræ and a leathern quiver containing copper-headed
arrows. At the feet were the bones of an ox, an iron knife, four
amphoraæ and some lances--these were in a very rusty condition. The
quiver had a fine gold-chased ornament upon it representing a flying
<a name="p130" id="p130"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 130</span>
eagle gripping in its talons a small animal. It is admirably worked.
The skeleton itself fell to pieces immediately.--<i>Biblia</i>, Oct., 1892.</p>
<br>

<p>SEMITIC EPIGRAPHY AND ANTIQUITIES.--M. Clermont-Ganneau has
published in the <i>Journal Asiatique</i> for 1892, No. 1, a series of the discoveries
and investigations made in Semitic epigraphy and antiquities
during the year 1891. It is the address by which he opened his
course at the Collège de France. He commences with Phœnicia and
notices besides such discoveries as are reported in the Journal, such
books as Goblet d'Aviella's <i>La migration des symboles</i>, which is a comparative
study of Oriental art symbols, and Ph. Berger's <i>Histoire de
l'écriture dans l'antiquité</i>, which treats especially of the development of
the Phœnician alphabet. As an original supplement he describes
some antiquities recently sent to him, which had been found in the
necropolis of Sidon, <i>e.g.</i>, a terracotta head of Egyptian style; a
smaller head of Cypriote style; a statuette of Bes; two gold ear-rings;
bottom of a Greek vase with a Phœnician inscription; piece of a
diorite scarcophagus cover of Egyptian origin, probably that of a king
of Sidon. Another complete anthropoid sarcophagus from the same
site at Sidon has been sent to Constantinople. Still another sarcophagus
of this type has been found in Spain, at Cadiz, the ancient
Gades. Its importance is incalculable, as it proves for the first time
the passing of the Phœnicians to Spain. Mr. Clermont-Ganneau then
takes up Aramean antiquities and inscriptions, especially those of
Palmyra. Among them are a number secured by the writer himself;
they are three fine monumental funerary inscriptions and six funerary
busts of men and women, two of which are finely executed and remarkably
well preserved; all are inscribed and several are dated.
He notices the publication of the valuable <i>Journal d'un voyage en
Arabie</i> (1883-1884) by Charles Huber, in which the five note-books of
the traveller are reproduced. It will be remembered that he was
treacherously murdered during his journey. Dr. Euting in his <i>Sinaïtische
Inschriften</i> publishes 67 inscriptions copied by him in the Sinaitic
peninsula. His readings are very careful and accurate. Three of the
texts are dated and are important in view of the controversy as to the
age of all these inscriptions.</p>

<p>Palestine and Hebrew antiquities are very fully treated. M. Clement-Ganneau
reads the famous Lachish inscription ךסהל = <i>ad libandum</i>;
he calls attention to hematite weight with an early inscription found
at Sebaste; mentions the vandalism perpetrated in cutting away the
famous Pool of Siloam inscription, <i>etc.</i> He notes the importance of
the discovery by MM. Lees and Hanauer in the subterranean structures
at Jerusalem called "Solomon's Stables," of the spring of an
<a name="p131" id="p131"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 131</span>
immense ancient arch, analogous to Robinson's arch. It introduces
quite a new element in the complicated problem of the Jewish Temple.
Mr. Wrightson, an English engineer, concludes that the two arches or
bridges formed part of a continuous system of parallel arches which
occupied, between the two east and west walls, the sub-structure of the
entire southern part of the esplanade of the temple. Mr. Schick's
investigations are carefully noticed. Finally praise is given to the
new publication of the Abbé Vigouroux, <i>Dictionnaire de la Bible</i>.</p>
<br>

<h3>ARABIA.</h3>
<br>

<p>A HISTORY OF YEMEN.--The British Museum acquired in 1886 the
MS. of Omârah's 'History of Yemen,' a work of which it was long
feared that no copy was at the present day in existence. Omârah's
'History' extends over a period of about three hundred and fifty
years. It commences with the foundation of the city and principality
of Zabid in the ninth century, and extends down to the eve of the
conquest by the Ayyûbites in the twelfth. Mr. Henry C. Kay, a
member of the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society, has prepared the
MS. for publication, together with an English translation, notes and
indices. The volume also contains, besides other similar matter, an
account and genealogical list of the Imāms of Yemen, down to the
thirteenth century, derived from the Zeydite MSS. recently added
to the British Museum library.--<i>Athenæum</i>.</p>
<br>

<p>COINS OF THE BENU RASOOL DYNASTY OF SULTANS.--Out of the
fourteen sovereigns who composed the Benu Rasool dynasty, we are
in possession of the coins of only eight, and these the first eight;
their inscriptions are in Arabic, and it is by no means easy to decipher
all of them. The mints of these are: Aden, Zebîd, El-Mahdjâm,
Thabat, Sana and Taiz, and each is characterized by a particular
figure, a fish for Aden, a bird for Zebîd, a lion for El-Mahdjâm, and
other symbols. There are also noticed several coins struck by rebels
under the Benu Rasool dynasty.--<i>Revue Numismatique</i>, III s. tom. 10,
III trim. 1892, p. 350.</p>
<br>

<h3>BABYLONIA.</h3>
<br>

<p>A BAS-RELIEF OF NARAM-SIN.--At a meeting of the <i>Acad. des Inscriptions</i>
M. Maspero exhibited a photograph of a Chaldean bas-relief
from Constantinople. It was erected by, and bears the name of King
Naram-sin, who reigned over Babylonia about 3800 B.C. Though
much mutilated, what remains shows workmanship of a refined
kind. It represents a human figure standing, clothed (as on the most
<a name="p132" id="p132"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 132</span>
ancient cylinders) with a robe that passes under one arm and over the
shoulder, and wearing a conical head-piece flanked with horns. The
general appearance strikingly recalls Egyptian monuments of the
same date. The relief is extremely low, the lines clear, but not stiff.
There is no muscular exaggeration as is often the case in the cylinders.
Naram-sin, like his father, Sargon I, has left the reputation (perhaps
legendary) of a great conqueror; a campaign against Magan is attributed
to him. M. Maspero was disposed to explain the style of the
bas-relief by the Egyptian influence. It differs widely from the
sculptures of Telloh, which are less refined and artistically advanced.
But these, though of later date, come from a provincial town, not from
a capital. M. Menant mentioned that the collection of M. de Clerq
contains a cylinder, also of remarkable workmanahip, with an inscription
with characters of the same style as those on the bas-relief in
question; but it bears the name of Sargani, king of Agyadi, who is
several generations earlier than Sargon I. Both of these are examples
of an art which was never surpassed in Chaldea.--<i>Academy</i>, Oct. 15;
<i>Chron. des Arts</i>, 1892, No. 33.</p>
<br>

<p>TELLOH.--BABYLONIAN SCULPTURE--The later excavations of M. de Sarzec
at Telloh, in so far as they concern sculpture, are treated by M. Heuzey
in some communications to the <i>Acad. des Inscriptions</i>. M. de Sarzec
has reconstructed from some fragments a series of reliefs relating to
King Ur-Nina, the ancestor of King E-anna-du, who is commemorated
in the <i>stele of the vultures</i>. The sculptures of Ur-Nina are of rude and
primitive workmanship and belong to the earliest period of Babylonian
sculpture. The king is represented more than once, either carrying
on his head the sacred basket, or seated and raising in his hand the
drinking-horn. Around him are ranged his children and servants,
all with their names inscribed upon the drapery. Among them is
A-kur-gal, who is to succeed his father, replacing another prince, his
older brother. The reunion of these fragments has given us an
historic and archæological document of the highest antiquity.--<i>Revue
Critique</i>, 1892, No. 44.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the <i>Acad. des Inscr.</i> M. Heuzey read a paper upon
the "Stèle des Vautours." M. de Sarzec has been able to find and
piece together several additional fragments, from which it appears
that the name of the person who set up the pillar was E-anna-du,
king of Sirpula, son of A-kur-gal, and grandson of King of Ur-Nina.
He is represented in front of his warriors, beating down his enemies,
sometimes on foot, sometimes in a chariot, of which only a trace remains.
The details of the armor resemble in some respects that of
<a name="p133" id="p133"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 133</span>
the Assyrians of a much later date. From what can be read of the
inscription, it seems that the conquered enemies belonged to the
country of Is-ban-ki. There is also mention of a city of Ur, allied
with Sirpula. The pillar was sculptured on both faces. On the reverse
is a royal or divine figure, of large size, holding in one hand the
heraldic design of Sirpula (an eagle with the head of a lion), while
the other brandishes a war-club over a crowd of prisoners, who are
tumbling one over another in a sort of net or cage. In illustration of
this scene, M. Heuzey quoted the passage from Habakkuk (i. 15),
describing the vengeance of the Chaldeans: "They catch them in their
net and gather them in their drag."--<i>Academy</i>, Sept. 3.</p>
<br>

<p>THE BABYLONIAN STANDARD WEIGHT.--Prof. Sayce writes: "Mr.
Greville Chester has become the possessor of a very remarkable relic
of antiquity, discovered in Babylonia, probably on the site of Babylon.
It is a large weight of hard green stone, highly polished, and of a
cone-like form. The picture of an altar has been engraved upon it,
and down one side runs a cuneiform inscription of ten lines. They
read as follows:</p>

<p>"One maneh standard weight, the property of Merodach-sar-ilani,
a duplicate of the weight which Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon,
the son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, made in exact accordance
with the weight prescribed by the deified Dungi, a former king."</p>

<p>The historical importance of the inscription is obvious at the first
glance. Dungi was the son and successor of Ur-Bagas, and his date
may be roughly assigned to about 3000 B.C. It would appear that he
had fixed the standard of weight in Babylonia; and the actual weight
made by him in accordance with this standard seems to have been
preserved down to the time of Nebuchadrezzar, who caused a duplicate
of it to be made. The duplicate again became the standard by which
all other weights in the country had to be tested.</p>

<p>The fact that Dungi is called "the deified" is not surprising. We
know of other early kings of Chaldaea who were similarly raised to
the rank of gods. One of them prefixes the title of "divine" to his
own bricks; another, Naram-Sin, the son of Sargon, of Accad, is called
"a god" on the seal of an individual who describes himself as his
"worshipper." It is possible that in this cult of certain Babylonian
kings we have an evidence of early intercourse with Egypt."--<i>Academy</i>,
Dec. 19.</p>
<br>

<p>CATALOGUE OF BRITISH MUSEUM TABLETS.--Stored in the British
Museum are some 50,000 inscribed pieces of terracotta or clay-tablets,
forming the libraries of Assyria and Babylonia. The great impetus
<a name="p134" id="p134"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 134</span>
given to cuneiform studies has made it necessary that the tablets
should be catalogued, and the trustees have now issued a descriptive
catalogue of some 8,000 inscribed tablets. The inscriptions in question
come from the Kuyuryik Mound, at Nineveh. The tablets embrace
every class of literature, historical documents, hymns, prayers and

<p>ASHNUNNAK.--M. Pognon, French Consul at Bagdad, has announced
to the <i>Acad. des Inscriptions</i> that he has discovered the exact location
of the region called anciently the land of Ashnunnak. He declares
that he is not yet ready to announce his discovery more exactly, but
publishes several bricks with the names and titles of several princes
of Ashnunnak hitherto unknown. These are Ibalpil, Amil and

<h3>PERSIA.</h3>
<br>

<p>M. de MORGAN'S RESEARCHES IN PERSIA AND LURISTAN.--In a communication
to the <i>Acad. des Inscr.</i> M. de Morgan gives a report upon
his mission in Persia and Luristan, of which the following are a few
extracts. "In the valley of the Lar, I made a study of the subterranean
habitations excavated in the rock and made a plan of the very
ancient castle, Molla-Kölo, which once defended the pass of Vahné.
Finally, in the ravine called <i>Ab-é-pardöma</i>, I discovered in the alluvion
some stone instruments presenting very ancient paleolithic characters.
At Amol, I studied the ruins of the ancient city and gathered some
interesting collections containing quite a number of pieces of pottery
and some bronzes of the xiv century."..... "Near Asterabad there
is a mound called <i>Khaighruch-tépè</i>. I attempted to make some excavations
of this point; unfortunately my work here was arrested by
order of the Persian government just when, after twenty days of
working with sixty laborers, I had reached a depth of 11½ meters.
In this excavation I found some human bones, some pottery, some
whorls and some thin objects composed of bronze much decomposed;
all in the midst of ashes and cooking-debris. At the bottom was a
skeleton stretched upon a very regular bed of pebbles, and I am of
the opinion that <i>Khaighruch-tépè</i> was primitively raised as a tomb and
afterwards served for the construction of a village, the successive ruins
of which coming to increase the importance of the mound. At a
depth of 11½ meters I found more cinders and debris, indicating that
I had not yet come to the level of the earliest works.".... "The
<i>tépès</i> are near together in the eastern part of the Mazanderan and in
<a name="p135" id="p135"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 135</span>
the Turkoman steppe; but in the Lenkoran, the Ghilan and the
western Mazanderan they are entirely wanting. It is concluded from
this observation that the people who built here were not aborigines
of the north of Persia, but that their migration moreover has left
traces on the right and on the left of the Caspian. The Scythians of
Herodotus present a very satisfactory solution for the problem of the
Caspian <i>tépès</i>".... "From an archaeological point of view the Lenkoran
was absolutely virgin soil and the finding of the first tomb was
not an easy task. Finally, after long and minute research in the
forests, I discovered the necropolis of Kravelady, composed of dolmens
almost completely despoiled, but in sufficiently good condition
to permit me to organize the natives in research for burial places of
the same sort. I at first encountered much repugnance on the part
of the inhabitants to excavate the tombs; finally, with some money
and very long explanations, I brought them to terms and, thanks to
my tomb-hunters, I found and excavated the necropoli of Horil,
Beri, Djon, Tülü, Mistaïl, Hiveri, <i>etc.</i> These tombs present, according
to their age, very different characteristics; the most ancient and at
the same time the largest, contain rude arms of bronze. Those of the
period following show the bronze well worked, iron, gold and silver
being employed as jewels. Although we saw iron in very small
quantities in the tombs of the second period, it is not until the third
that it appears as the material of arms; at the same time, the jewels
take the forms of animals, which change, as I have shown in the case
of Russian Armenia in my preceding mission, indicates the appearance
of a strange tribe possessed of special arts. During the last
epoch all the arms are of iron. The pottery found in the tombs is
glazed.</p>

<p>"As to the form of the monuments, it is very variable at different
ages; there are some covered passages or chambers completely closed,
some dolmens with openings like those of India. At the very time
when my excavations were attaining their greatest importance I was
compelled to discontinue them by order of the Russian administration
and was obliged to leave the country, having only made a
beginning in archaeology. An <i>ukase</i> of the Czar reserves the excavations
in all his great empire for the Archæological Society of St.
Petersburg. But this interdict did not arrive until after I had excavated
about two hundred and twenty tombs, so that we now possess
more than fifteen hundred objects, vases, arms, trinkets of gold,bronze,
silver, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p>"At Moukri, thanks to the kindness of a Kurd chief, I was enabled
to excavate a tomb which, although it held no objects of value, still
<a name="p136" id="p136"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 136</span>
contained some interesting relics. I have not yet been able to assign a
date to any of them." .... "During my stay at Moukri I set up a
map on the scale of 1/250000, and marked upon it all the ruins, mounds
and ancient tombs....</p>

<p>"Although blockaded by snow at Hamadan I was able to visit the
ancient Ecbatana and there acquired a small collection of Greek jewels
and Chaldean cylinders. I found no trace whatever of the ancient
palace; they told me that the last debris had been reduced to lime
and that houses had been built over the rest. On the other hand, the
trilingual inscription of the Elvend, the <i>Ghendj-nûméh</i>, is still admirably
preserved, but the cold prevented me from taking a squeeze.
After having visited and photographed the ruins of Dinâver, Kinghârer,
Bisoutoun and several remains encountered on the route, I
visited Tagh-é-Bostan, near Kirmanshahan; I took numerous photographs
and squeezes of the more interesting fragments, like the pahlavi
inscriptions of the smallest monument. At Zohab, I took the
inscriptions of Ler-é-poul and of Hourin-cheïkh-khan, made plans of
the ruins of Ler-é-poul, those of the Sassanian palace of
Kasr-é-Chirîon
and of Haoueh-Ruri; drew up a map on a scale of 1/250000 of
the gates of the Zagros, and of the country around." ..... "Having
arrived at Houleilan,..... I found the remains of a large number of
towns and castles of the Sassanian epoch, besides some very ancient
<i>tépès</i>. At Chirvan, near the fort of the Poncht-é-Kouh, are the ruins
of a Sassanian town. I made a plan of it. Near it is a great <i>tell</i> of
unburnt brick...... In the valleys, situated near the plain, in the
passes are some <i>tells</i>, and it is near one of them that I had the good
fortune to find more than eight hundred objects carved in flint. Beyond
these <i>tells</i> which guard the frontier of the Semite border, the
Poncht-é-Kouh does not contain a single ruin. In antiquity, as
to-day, it was inhabited by nomads. On leaving the Poncht-é-Kouh,
I entered the valley of the Kukha, where I encountered numerous
ruins. I then advanced into Louristan, continually finding <i>tells</i>, of
which the principal ones are those of Zakha and of Khorremâbâd.
..... Finally arriving at Susiana, we again found civilization, but
also a country well known and that does not form a part of my
mission."--<i>Journal Asiatique</i>, No. 2, 1892, pp. 189-200.</p>

<p>COINS OF THE SATRAPS.--1. Money had been invented and was in circulation
in the Greek cities of Asia Minor almost two hundred years,
when Darius I introduced the daric. The Greek coins in circulation
along the coast had not penetrated far from the Mediterranean, even
the new Persian coinage was used chiefly in the commerce with the
Greeks on the frontier, and for the payment of Greek mercenaries,
<a name="p137" id="p137"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 137</span>
enrolled in the armies of the Great King. The interior of the empire,
during the whole period of the Achæmenidæ, continued to employ
wedges of precious metals in exchange. The coinage of the Persian
empire divides into four clearly defined groups, according to the direct
authority of its issue. (1) The coinage of the Great King; (2) The
coinage of the tributary Greek towns; (3) The coinage of the tributary
dynasties; (4) The coinage occasionally struck for the satraps, chiefs
of the Persian army. It is the last category that is described in the
paper here summarized. The towns then, and the tributary dynasties,
and, under some circumstances, the satraps enjoyed the right to coin
money but only in electrum, silver and bronze; the great King reserved
the exclusive right to issue coins in gold; and this principle became
universally acknowledged, so that gold effectually became the unique
standard of the Persian empire. The few departures from this rule
are not worthy of consideration. The towns of Asia Minor paying
tribute to the great King continued to issue money, just as they had
during their independence, retaining their own types, and betraying
in no way their subjection. The tributary kings placed under the
surveillance of satraps were allowed various degrees of liberty in issuing
coinage, according to their countries and to their varying relations
to the persian monarch; the dynasties of Caria, of Cyprus, of Gebal
and of Tyre, like the tributary cities mentioned above, continued their
old coinage, while those of Sidon and of Cilicia placed upon their
coins, the figure of the Achæmenidean prince.</p>

<p>Besides the coinage already mentioned there exists a number of
coins bearing the names of satraps, and the questions are raised, under
what circumstances were these issued, and with what extraordinary
powers was a satrap invested, who was permitted to issue money in
his own name? The theory is advanced, that the satraps of the
Persian empire never held the right to coin money in their capacity
as satraps. All the instances we have of satrapal coins were issued
by satraps invested with the command of armies. Fr. Lenormant
says: "All the pieces known, which bear the names of high functionaries
of Persia, mentioned in history, particularly those of Cilicia,
should be ranged in the class of military coins; that is, coins issued by
generals placed at the head of armies, on a campaign, and not as
satraps exercising their regular powers." The only satrapies in which
money was coined, before Alexander, are the following. The sixth
satrapy, which comprised Egypt and Cyrenaica. The fifth satrapy or
that of Syria, comprising Arabia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Phœnicia, Palestine
and the island of Cyprus. The fourth satrapy or that of Cilicia,
which acquired in the V century the states north of the Taurus. The
<a name="p138" id="p138"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 138</span>
first satrapy or that of Ionia, comprising Pamphilia, Lycia, Caria,
Pisidia, Ionia and Eolis. The twelfth satrapy, known as the satrapy
of Sardis, or of Lydia. The thirteenth satrapy, known also as the
satrapy of Phrygia, which comprised, besides the coast of the Hellespont,
all the central region of Asia Minor between the Taurus and
the Black Sea. This huge province was divided in the fifth century
into the satrapies of Greater Phrygia, Lesser Phrygia, and Cappadocia.</p>

<p>2. The coinage in circulation in Egypt, during the Achæmenidean
supremacy was all of foreign origin, the staters of the Kings of Tyre
and Sidon and the tetradrachmas of Athens. The commerce with
Greece, and especially the incessant wars in which Greek mercenaries
were largely employed, tended to make Athenian silver popular in
the eastern countries. For the pay of these mercenaries, the Persians
and Egyptians had recourse to silver money, and especially to those
types with which the Greeks were acquainted. Thus the prevalence
of Athenian coins in the Orient is accounted for by these circumstances.
The generals of the Persian and Egyptian armies made
use of the Athenian coins which had long been in circulation in the
country. They merely imprinted upon the coin of Attic origin a
counter-mark to officially authorize the circulation, and when the
original Athenian coins in the country were insufficient to pay the
troops, they struck off others as nearly like them as possible--these,
however, are easily recognized by the defects of workmanship and
altered inscriptions. One sort has in place of the Greek lettering an
Aramean inscription. On a certain number of these we find the name
Mazaios, the famous satrap of Cilicia, who undertook to subdue the
insurgent king of Sidon.</p>

<p>The imitation of Athenian coins and the coins of Alexander was
continued in Arabia down to the first century of our era. The
Athenian coins were not the only ones copied in Egypt, Palestine,
and Arabia. The coinage of the kings of Sidon were frequently imitated
by the Aramean chiefs, of whom Bagoas was one. Then, too,
the kings of Sidon had supreme command of the imperial fleet and
had the paying of the naval army. Later, Mazaios, placed at the head
of the Persian army, for a time imitated the Sidonian coins, substituting
his name for that of the Sidonian dynasty. Bagoas, in turn,
did likewise.</p>

<p>3. In Phœnicia and northern Syria, which formed the greater part
of the fifth satrapy, a great quantity of coins were struck off by the
tributary dynasties.    The kings of Tyre, Sidon, Gebal, and Aradus
had their own coinage, but there seems to have been no satrapal
coinage struck off in Phœnicia. In northern Syria, when Mazaios
<a name="p139" id="p139"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 139</span>
added this satrapy to his own, he levied and assembled troops from
that entire region; this accounts for the numerous issues of coins in
northern Syria at that time.</p>

<p>4. The dynasties of Cilicia coined money under the same conditions
as did the cities of Phœnicia, Caria and Lydia. The chief mint of
Cilicia was at Tarsus, but money was also coined at Soli and at
Mallus. About the end of the fifth century a coinage was issued
from these mints which is ascribed to uncertain satraps. The distinguishing
mark of these coins, according to Mr. Waddington, is the
use of the neuter adjective in ικον, but this theory is not conclusive.
Besides these anonymous coins there were others coined in Cilicia
bearing the names of satraps, who were the envoys of the great king
to raise armies and equip fleets. The satrap Tiribazus employed
the mints at Issus, at Soli and Mallus; the satrap Pharnabazus established
his mints in various cities in Cilicia, particularly at Nagidus;
Datamus also issued coinage in Cilicia. M. Six holds that Mazaios
coined money, not only in Cilicia, but also in Syria and Mesopotamia,
and preserved the right to a coinage under Alexander, but always in
a military capacity.</p>

<p>5. After the conquest of Alexander, his generals issued coinage
under his name in their satrapal authority. These were the coins of
Alexander, bearing on one side the particular symbol of the generals
who had issued them; there were the eagle of Ptolemy, the demi-lion
of Lysimachus or the horned horse of Seleucus. Those of the generals
who became kings, in 306, issued coins in their own name, preserving
on them the personal emblems which they had employed in their
satrapal authority. The generals who did not become kings never
issued a coinage in their own names.</p>

<p>6. On the island of Cyprus are found numerous coins which present
all the distinctive signs of satrapal money; they are believed to have
been struck by Evagoras II, the successor of Nicocles I; but the
question arises, Were these satrapal pieces of Evagoras coined on the
island? It has been held that they were issued from a mint on the
continent, in Caria, because the army of Evagoras was recruited in
Asia Minor, and because their weights are Rhodian, but the form of
the letters is Phœnician, as upon all Cypriote corns; while, on the
other hand, in Asia Minor the Semitic money is inscribed with
Aramean characters. Moreover, all symbols and types which figure
on these coins are essentially Cypriote.--E. BABELON in <i>Revue Numismatique</i>,
1892, p. 277.</p>
<br>

<p>SASSANIAN COINS.--The Museum of the Hermitage has just come
into possession of the collection of coins of General Komarof, once
<a name="p140" id="p140"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 140</span>
governor of Russian Turkistan. It consists of more than two thousand
pieces, of which sixty are of gold. The most remarkable coins
of this rich collection are: Four Sassanian pieces in gold, unpublished,
(one of Hormuzd II and three of Sapor II), a dinar of Nasr I, a
dinar of Kharmezi of Tamerlan, a dinar of Abdallah-ben-Khazim,
and about fifty unpublished Sassanian silver coins.--<i>Revue Numismatique</i>,
1892, p. 348.</p>
<br>

<p>PERSEPOLIS.--CASTS OF SCULPTURES.--The English archæologist Mr.
Cecil Smith has lately returned from an expedition to Persia. He
had with him two Italian makers of casts, and by their means has
obtained a valuable series of casts of the sculptures of Persepolis from
moulds of a fibrous Spanish paper. Among the casts are those of a
long frieze (perron) which decorated the stairway of the main hall or
"apadâna," erected by Xerxes; it represents a procession of figures
presenting to the king the reports of his governors and the offerings
of his subjects. Another cast is that of the famous monolith of Cyrus.
--<i>Chron. des Arts</i>, 1892, No. 31. We understand that the collection of
casts of the Metropolitan Museum is to receive a copy of all these casts.</p>

<h3>SYRIA.</h3>
<br>

<p>EDESSA.-- HISTORICAL SKETCH.--M. Rubens Duval, the eminent Syriac
scholar, has been publishing in the <i>Journal Asiatique</i> a history of the
city of Edessa under the title: "<i>Histoire religieuse et litteraire d'Edesse
jusqu' à la première Croisade</i>", (<i>Jour. As.</i> t. 18, No. 1 to t. 19, No. 1).
This monograph has been crowned by the French Academy. It includes
a considerable amount of information concerning the monuments
of the city, especially those belonging to the early Christian
period, and some idea can be gained of them by the following abridged
note. As Edessa was one of the principal cities of the Christian East,
the information is of interest. Edessa was from its position a fortress
of the first rank and reputed impregnable. The citadel rose on a peak
on the southwest angle of the rampart. At the west end there still
remain two columns with Corinthian capitals, one of which bears an
inscription with the name of Queen Shalmat, daughter of Ma'nu,
probably the wife of King Abgar Ukhama. Within the citadel, on the
great square called Beith-Tebhara, King Abgar VII built, after the inundation
of 202, a winter palace, safe from the river floods, and the
nobles followed his example. In the city itself were the porticoes or
forum near the river, the Antiphoros or town-hall, restored by Justinian.
In 497, the governor of the city, Alexander, built a covered
gallery near the Grotto Gate and Public Baths, near the public
storehouse;
<a name="p141" id="p141"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 141</span>
both the summer and winter baths were surrounded by a
double colonnade. To the south, near the Great Gate, were other
baths, and near them the theatre. Within the Beth Shemesh Gate
was a hospital and outside it a refuge for old men. North of the city,
near the wall, was the hippodrome, built by Abgarus IX on his return
from Rome. The city had six gates which still exist under different
names.</p>

<p>Edessa is one of the few cities that are known to have had a Christian
church as early as the second century. This church was destroyed
by the inundation of 201, was then rebuilt, being the only church in
the city, suffered from the inundation of 303 and was rebuilt from its
foundations in 313 by Cona, bishop of Edessa, and his successor Sa'd.
It was called the Ancient Church, "the cathedral," also sometimes the
Church of St. Thomas, because in 394 it received the relics of the
apostle Thomas. The Frankish pilgrim woman who visited it at the
close of the fourth century, or later, speaks of its size, beauty and the
novelty of its arrangement. Duval believes her words to relate to
Justinian's building, believing in a later date than is usually assigned
to the above document. In 525 the church was overthrown by an inundation
and then rebuilt by Justinian in such splendor as to be regarded
as one of the wonders of the world. It was overthrown by
earthquakes in 679 and 718.</p>

<p>The other churches were as follows:</p>

<pre>
  370. The Baptistery is built.
  379. Church of S. Daniel or S. Domitius, built by Bishop Vologese.
  409. Church of S. Barlaha, built by Bishop Diogenes.
  412. Church of S. Stephen, formerly a Jewish synagogue, built by
         Bishop Rabbula.
  435. The New Church, called later the Church of the Holy Apostles,
         built by Bishop Hibhas.
   "   Church of S. John the Baptist and S. Addasus, built by Bishop
         Nonnus (died 471), successor of Hibhas.
   "   Church of S. Mar Cona.
  489. Church of the Virgin Mother of God, built on the site of the
         School of the Persians after its destruction in 489.
c.505. Martyrium of the Virgin, built by Bishop Peter early in VI
         century.
</pre>

<a name="p142" id="p142"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 142</span>

<p>Outside the walls were the following churches:

<pre>
Towards the N. Chapel of SS. Cosmas and Damian, built by Nonnus
                (middle ν century).

            E. Church of SS. Sergius and Simeon, which was burned
                in 503 by the Persian King Kawad.

            W. Church of Confessors, built in 346 by Bishop Abraham,
                 and burned by Kawad in 503.
               Church of the Monks, near the citadel.
</pre>

<p>The cliffs to the west had been from early times excavated for burial
purposes. In the midst of the tombs rose the mausoleums of the
family of the Abgars, especially that of Abshelama, son of Abgarus.
They were also honeycombed with anchorites' cells. This mountain
received the name of the Holy Mountain and was covered with monasteries,
among which were the following: Eastern Monks; S. Thomas;
S. David; S. John; S. Barbara; S. Cyriacus; Phesilta; Mary <i>Deipara</i>;
of the Towers; of Severus; of Sanin; of Kuba; of S. James. Arab
writers mention over 300 monasteries around Edessa. Two aqueducts,
starting from the villages of Tell-Zema and Maudad to the north,
brought spring-water to the city; they were restored in 505 by
Governor Eulogius.</p>

<p>Bishop Rabbulas (412-435) built a hospital for women from the
stones of four pagan temples which were destroyed. He destroyed the
church of the sect of Bardesanes and the church of the Arians, erecting
other structures with their materials. After the Persian wars (505)
Eulogius, governor of Edessa, rebuilt many of the damaged public
monuments. He repaired the outer ramparts and the two aqueducts;
rebuilt the public baths, the prætorium, and other structures. The
bishop, Peter, restored the cathedral and built the Martyrium of the
Virgin, and also covered with bronze one of the cathedral doors.
Justinian restored and rebuilt many buildings after the inundation of
524-25. Even under the early period of Muhammadan rule the
Christian structures were cared for. Under the Khalif Abd-el-Malik
(685-705) the Edessene Christian Athanasius, who enjoyed great
political influence, rebuilt the Church of the Virgin, which was on the
site of the School of the Persians; rebuilt also the Baptistery in which
he placed the portrait of Christ sent to Abgarus and placed in it
fountains like those of the Ancient Church, decorating it also with
gold, silver and bronze revetments. He also built two large basilicas
at Fostat in Egypt. There is an interesting account of an artistic
treasure of great value discovered in a house belonging to a noble
family of the Goumêaus in 797 and belonging to the Roman and Byzantine
period; it is supposed to have been hidden in 609. The
churches were often destroyed and rebuilt according to the tolerance
or intolerance of the Muhammadan governors. At one period of persecution,
c. 825, a mosque was built in the <i>tetrapylum</i> in front of the
Ancient Church. It is not important to trace the vicissitudes of the
building of Edessa any further.</p>
<br>
<a name="p143" id="p143"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 143</span>

<p>COINS OF THE KINGS OF EDESSA.--Marquis de Vogué sends to M.E.
Babelon a description of a bronze coin brought from Syria, found
either in the province of Alep or of Damas. It bears the name of
Abgarus, the name of several of the kings of Edessa. The type is that
of the small bronze pieces attributed to Mannou VIII; the character
and inscriptions are the same. It must then be attributed to a king
Abgarus whose reign approaches as nearly as possible that of Mannou
VIII. Mr. Rubens Duval, in his history of Edessa, mentions two
kings of this name, Abgarus VIII, whose reign cut into that of Mannou
VIII, and Abgarus IX, who succeeded him. It is to one of these
two princes that this coin must be assigned. It is possible that this
monument may shed some light upon a portion of Oriental chronology,
hitherto very dark. Two other coins are described from M. Vogué's
collection, one of which, it seems, should be attributed to the same
king Abgarus as the preceding; the other bears a name which M. Duval
assigns to Abgarus XI, who reigned for two years during a short
restoration of the government of Edessa.--<i>Revue Numismatique</i>, 1892,
p. 209.</p>
<br>

<p>SINJIRLI.--SEMITIC INSCRIPTIONS.--The German Oriental Committee discovered,
as is well known, an ancient city buried under a number of
mounds at a place called Sinjirli in the Amanus Mountains. Here
were found a number of statues bearing cuniform inscriptions, Hittite
inscriptions and two long Aramean inscriptions of the VIII or IX
century B.C.</p>

<p>M. Helévy, the well-known French Orientalist, was sent by the Paris
Institute to the Museum of Berlin, where these statues are placed,
to report upon the inscriptions. M. Helévy finds that the two kings
were rulers of Yadi and that their reigns were a century apart. The
first statue is that of Panémon, founder of his dynasty--a 40 line inscription
relates the events of his reign, the protection of the Jews, <i>etc.</i>
The second is a king who was a vassal of Tiglath-Pilezer, king of
Assyria. The inscription describes wars of his father, his own relations
with Assyria, his defeats and victories. It gives an account of
his own reign and terminates by invoking the protection of the gods.</p>

<p>M. Helévy says that these inscriptions are not in the Aramean language,
as was first supposed, but a Phœnician dialect very analogous
to Hebrew, which was spoken by the people whom the Assyrians
named Hatte, that is to say, Hittites or Hetheim. He adds that the
current opinion as to their not being of Semitic race is quite erroneous
and that the hieroglyphics discovered in various parts of Asia Minor
are of Anatolian and not of Assyrian origin, the few texts of this kind
found at Hamath and Aleppo being due to Anatolian conquerors,
<a name="p144" id="p144"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 144</span>
whose domination, however, was very temporary in character.--<i>Journal
of the Royal Asiatic Society</i>, 1892, Oct., p. 887.</p>
<br>

<p>NAMES OF CITIES AT MEDINET HABU.--Prof. Sayce writes: The list
of places conquered by Rameses III in Palestine and Syria, which I
copied on the pylon of Medinet Habu, turns out to be even more
interesting than I had supposed, as a whole row of them belongs to
the territory of Judah. Thus we have the "land of Salem," which,
like the Salam of Rameses II, is shown by the Tell-el-Amarna tablets
to be Jerusalem, <i>arez hadast</i>, or "New Lands," the Hadashah of Joshua
(XV. 37), Shimshana or Samson, "the city of the Sun" (Josh. XV. 10),
Carmel of Judah, Migdol (Josh. XV. 37), Apaka or Aphekah (Josh. XV.
53), "the Springs of Khibur" or Hebron, Shabuduna, located near
Gath, by Thothmes III, and Beth-Anath, the Beth-Anoth of Joshua
(XV. 59). The discovery of these names in the records of an Egyptian
king, who reigned about 1200 B.C., raises a question of some interest
for students of the Old Testament.--<i>Academy</i>, April 2.</p>
<br>

<p>JAFFA.--The Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund have
received through Mr. Bliss a squeeze of a long inscription stated
to have been recently discovered at a place not far from Jaffa, which
appears to contain about 250 letters in the Phœnician character.--<i>Academy</i>,
March 5.</p>
<br>

<p>JERUSALEM.--A BYZANTINE BRACELET.--Mr. Maxwell Somerville of
Philadelphia has added to his collection a large bronze bracelet
found near Jerusalem and bearing a Greek inscription. It was communicated
to the <i>Acad. des Inscr.</i> by M. le Blant. At one end of the
inscription is a lion <i>courant</i>, at the other a serpent <i>rampant</i>. On the
left end is soldered a small round plaque on which is engraved a subject
identical with that found on some of the amulets published by
M. Schlumberger in the <i>Rev. des Études Grecques</i> (see under <i>Byzantine
Amulets</i> in Greek news of this number). A mounted warrior--whom
Mr. Schlumberger identifies as Solomon--pierces with his lance a
prostrate female figure who apparently represents the devil, a "Fra
Diavalo."--<i>Chron. des Arts</i>, 1892, No. 23.</p>
<br>

<p>RETHPANA-DEAD SEA.--Prof. Sayce has discovered at Medinet Habû
the Egyptian name of the Dead Sea. Between the names of Salem
and Yerdano and the Jordan comes "the lake of Rethpana." As the
Dead Sea is the only "lake" in that part of the world, the identification
of the name is certain. Rethpana could correspond with a
Canaanite Reshpôn, a derivative from Reshpu, the sun-god, who revealed
himself in flames of fire.--<i>Academy</i>, May 14.</p>

<p>TEL-EL-HESY--LACHISH.--CUNEIFORM TABLET.--We quote from a letter
written to the Times by Mr. James Glaisher, chairman of the executive
committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund:--</p>

<p>"The excavations commenced two years ago by Dr. Flinders Petrie
at a mound in Palestine named Tell-el-Hesy have been continued
during the last six months by Mr. F.J. Bliss, of Beirût. The Tell
has been identified by Major Conder and Dr. Flinders Petrie with the
ancient city of Lachish, an identification which is now amply confirmed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bliss has found among the <i>débris</i> a cuneiform tablet, together
with certain Babylonian cylinders and imitations or forgeries of those
manufactured in Egypt. A translation of the tablet has been made
by Prof. Sayce; it is as follows:--</p>

<p>'To the Governor. [I] 0, my father, prostrate myself at thy feet.
Verily thou knowest that Baya (?) and Zimrida have received thy
orders (?) and Dan-Hadad says to Zimrida, "0, my father, the city of
Yarami sends to me, it has given me 3 <i>masar</i> and 3 ... and 3 falchions."
Let the country of the King know that I stay, and it has acted against
me, but till my death I remain. As for thy commands (?) which I
have received, I cease hostilities, and have despatched Bel(?)-banilu,
and Rabi-ilu-yi has sent his brother to this country to [strengthen
me (?)].'</p>

<p>"The letter was written about the year 1400 B.C. It is in the same
handwriting as those in the Tell-el-Amarna collection, which were
sent to Egypt from the south of Palestine about the same time.</p>

<p>"Now, here is a very remarkable coincidence. In the Tell-el-
Amarna collection we learn that one Zimrida was governor of Lachish,
where he was murdered by some of his own people, and the very first
cuneiform tablet discovered at Tell-el-Hesy is a letter written to this
Zimrida.</p>

<p>"The city Yarami may be the Jarmuth of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>"'Even more interesting,' writes Prof. Sayce, 'are the Babylonian
cylinders and their imitations. They testify to the long and deep influence
and authority of Babylon in Western Asia, and throw light on
the prehistoric art of Phœnicia and Cyprus. The cylinders of native
Babylonian manufacture belong to the period B.C. 2000-1500; the rest
are copies made in the West. One of these is of Egyptian porcelain,
and must have been manufactured in Egypt, in spite of its close imitation
of a Babylonian original. Others are identical with the cylinders
found in the prehistoric tombs of Cyprus and Syria, and so fix the
date of the latter. On one of them are two centaurs arranged heraldically,
the human faces being shaped like those of birds. European
<a name="p146" id="p146"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 146</span>
archæologists will be interested in learning that among the minor objects
are two amber beads."--<i>Academy</i>, July 9.</p>

<p>The <i>Quarterly Statement</i> of the Palestine Exploration Fund for April
contains a detailed report of Mr. F.J. Bliss's excavations at Tell-el-Hesy,
the site of Lachish, during last winter, illustrated with several
plans and woodcuts. The most interesting objects found were a number
of bronze weapons, and fragments of pottery with markings, both
from the lowest or Amorite town. Mr. W.M. Flinders Petrie adds a
note on the weights discovered, almost all of which belong to the
Phœnician and Aeginetan systems.</p>

<h3>ARMENIA.</h3>
<br>

<p>SEALS OF KING LEO II AND LEO V.--At a meeting of the <i>Acad. des
Inscr.</i> M. Schlumberger communicated three magnificent bulls or gold
seals of Leo II, king of Lesser Armenia. These gold bulls, appended
to letters from this king to Pope Innocent III, written early in the
XIII century, are preserved in the Vatican archives, and are probably
the only examples of the king in existence. Leo II, in royal costume,
is on one side; the lion of Armenia on the other. Another royal Armenian
seal is preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale. It is that of
Leo V, the last king of the dynasty, who died, an exile, in Paris.--<i>Chron. des Arts</i>,
1892, No, 6.</p>
<br>



<h3>CAUCASUS.</h3>
<br>

<p>THE IRON AGE.--M. Ernest Ghautre has given a statement of his
ideas on the iron age in the Caucasus and elsewhere in a pamphlet
entitled, <i>Origine et Ancienneté du premier age du fer au Caucase</i>, Lyon,
1892. He says: "Necropoli of unequalled richness have been discovered
in the Great Caucasus and on several points of Transcaucasia.
These necropoli, in which inhumation appears to have been almost
exclusively used, should be divided into two large groups. The most
ancient corresponds to the Hallstatt period; the later to the Scythian
period in the East and the Gallic period in the West. The Hallstatt
type or that of the first iron age is met with especially in the most
ancient tombs of the necropolis of Kobau, in Ossethia; those of the
second iron age are to be found essentially in the necropolis of Kambylte
in Digouria and certain localities of Armenia. The first iron age
was introduced into the region of the Caucasus between the XX and
XV century B.C. by a dolichocephalic population of Mongolo-Semitic
or Semito-Kushite and not of Iranian origin. It was transformed
toward the VII century by the invasion of a brachycephalic Scythian
people of Ural-Altaic origin.</p>

ancient capital. They have found some ecclesiastical and other antiquities.--<i>Athenæum</i>,

<h3>ASIA MINOR.</h3>
<br>

<p>PRIVATE GREEK COINAGE BY REFUGEES.--The Persian kings accorded
to certain illustrious Greeks who had sought refuge in Asia Minor on
Persian territory the right to coin money. To this they joined the
privileges inherent in the title of hereditary despot which was granted
to them. The principal coinages are those of Themistokles at Magnesia,
of Georgion at Gambrium, and of Euripthenes at Pergamon. M. Babelon
read a memoir on the subject before the <i>Soc. des Antiquaires</i>,
giving genealogical details regarding those families of exiles.--<i>Chron.
des Arts</i>, 1892, No. 16.</p>
<br>


<p>COMPARISON OF HITTITE AND MYCENÆAN SCULPTURES.--M. Heuzey
has read before the <i>Acad. des Inscr.</i> (Oct. 14) a comparative study
on an engraved gold ring found at Mycenæ and a relief in the Louvre
which belongs to the series of Hittite reliefs and was found at Kharpout,
in the Upper Euphrates region on the frontier of Armenia and
Cappadocia. The relief is surmounted by two lines of ideographic
inscription. The subject on both is a stag-hunt; the stag is hunted in
a chariot, as was always done before the horse was used for riding, that
is before the VIII century B.C. The relief is a rustic variant of the
Assyrian style; certain details prove it to belong to the IX century.
The stag is of the variety called <i>hamour</i> by the Arabs, characterized
by horns palm-shaped at their extremities. On the ring the attitudes
are far more lively and bold, but the identity of the subject is none
the less striking.--<i>Revue Critique</i>, 1892, No. 43.</p>
<br>

<p>HITTITE INSCRIPTION.--M. Menant has communicated to the <i>Acad.
des Inscr.</i> (Aug. 7, 1891,) a new Hittite inscription, noted during the
preceding summer, in the pass of Bulgar-Maden, in Asia Minor. It is
in perfect preservation and of unusual length, and is therefore of great
value for the study of the Hittite language. M. Menant sees at the
beginning the genealogy and titles of a prince, some other of whose
inscriptions have already been found; then an invocation to the patron
divinities of his kingdom; then the main body of the inscription,
which will doubtless be the most difficult to decipher; and at the
close a re-enumeration of the divinities already invoked.--<i>Revue
Critique</i>, 1891, No. 35-6.</p>
<br>

<p>THE DECIPHERMENT OF THE HITTITE INSCRIPTIONS.--Prof. Sayce
writes: "I have, I believe, at last succeeded in breaking through the
<a name="p148" id="p148"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 148</span>
blank wall of the Hittite decipherment. Twelve years ago, with the
help of the bilingual text of Tarkondêmos, I advanced a little way,
but want of material prevented me from going further. At length,
however, the want has been supplied, and new materials have come to
hand, chiefly through the discoveries of Messrs. Ramsay, Hogarth,
and Headlam in Asia Minor. The conclusions to be derived from the
latter are stated in an article of mine which has just been published
in the last number of the <i>Recueil de Travaux relatifs à la Philogie et à
l'Archéologie égyptiennes et assyriennes</i>. Since that article was written, I
have once more gone through the Hittite texts in the light of our
newly-acquired facts, and have, I believe, succeeded in making out
the larger part of them.</p>

<p>As in the languages of Van, of Mitanni, and of Arzana, the Hittite
noun possessed a nominative in <i>-s</i>, an accusative in <i>-n</i>, and an oblique
case which terminated in a vowel, while the adjective followed the
substantive, the same suffixes being attached to it as to the substantive
with which it agreed. The character which I first conjectured to have
the value of <i>se</i>, and afterwards of <i>me</i>, really has the value of <i>ne</i>.</p>

<p>The inscriptions of Hamath, like the first and third inscriptions of
Jerablûs, are records of buildings, the second inscription of Jerablûs
is little more than a list of royal or rather high-priestly titles, in which
the king "of Eri and Khata" is called "the beloved of the god (Sutekh),
the mighty, who is under the protection of the god Sarus, the regent
of the earth, and the divine Nine; to whom the god (Sutekh) has
given the people of Hittites... the powerful (prince), the prophet of
the Nine great gods, beloved of the Nine and of ..., son of the god."
The first inscription of Jerablûs states that "the high priest and his
god have erected "images" to Sarus- * -erwes and his son." Who the
latter were is not mentioned, nor is the name of the son given. Those
who have read what I have written formerly on the Hittite inscriptions
will notice that I was wrong in supposing that Sarus- * -erwes
and his father were the father and grandfather of the Carchemish
king to whom the monument belongs.-<i>Academy</i>, May 21, 1892.</p>

<p>One of the most curious facts that result from my decipherment of
the texts--supposing it to be correct--is the close similarity that
exists between the titles assumed by the Hittite princes and those of
the Egyptian Pharaohs of the XVIII and XIX dynasties. The fact has
an important bearing on which the monuments of Hamath and Carchemish
must be assigned. The similarity extends beyond the titles, the
Hittite system of writing presenting in many respects a startling parallelism
to that of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. Thus, "word" or
"order" is denoted by a head, a phonetic character, and the ideograph
<a name="p149" id="p149"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 149</span>
of "speaking," the whole being a fairly exact counterpart of the Egyptian
<i>tep-ro</i>, an "oral communication." It would seem as if the inventer
of the Hittite hieroglyphs had seen those of Egypt, just as
Doalu, the inventor of the Sei syllabary, is known to have seen
European writing. This likeness between the graphic systems of the
Hittites and Egyptians has been a surprise to me, since I had hitherto
believed that, as the Hittite hieroglyphs are so purely native in origin,
the graphic system to which they belong must also be purely native.--<i>Academy</i>,
May 21.</p>
<br>


<p>ARAMΕΑΝ COINS OF CAPPADOCIA.--M. Six, enumerating all the coins
bearing the names of Datames, mentions only those of the ordinary
type of Sinope, with a Greek inscription. M. Babelon finds coins of
Datames in Cilicia as well, and reads this name in the Aramean inscriptions
which M. Six interprets <i>Tarcamos</i>. The name of Datames
is historic, but the reading of M. Six has not come down to us. The
coins in question bear a striking likeness to those of Pharnabazus,
their types being identical. We know that Datames succeeded Pharnabazus
in the command of the Persian armies, their coins then must
have been struck under the same circumstances and in the same mints,
that is, in the ports of Cilicia where preparations were made for the
expedition against Egypt. Later, Datames was charged with subduing
the rebellious Sinope, here we have an explanation of the coins
of Sinopean type bearing the name of Datames. Why may not this
man be the same whom Diodorus designates satrap of Cappadocia?</p>

<p>2. There are two similar drachmas, one in possession of the Cabinet
des Medailles, the other in the Waddington collection; they are Cappadocian
coins of the type of Sinope, like those of Datames. The
Aramean inscription on the back of these coins has been given a
variety of interpretations which appear to be equally possible. M.
Babelon, after careful study, fixes upon <i>Abrocomou</i>, the only reading
in which we can recognize an historic personage. Abrocomas was one
of the principal lieutenants of Artaxerxes II and was a colleague of
Pharnabazus in the Egyptian campaign. If we accept this reading of
the drachma's inscription we must infer that Abrocomas became
satrap of Cappadocia, he was in all probability successor to Datames,
his coins plainly of later date; their weight and their style show that
they belong to the older coinage of Sinope and they are no less certainly
anterior to those of Arianthes, which they somewhat resemble.

<p>3. Arianthes must have been the immediate successor of Abrocomas,
the identity of style, of types and of material in these coins point to
this conclusion. M. Six places two governors of Cappadocia between
Datames and Arianthes, whose names he finds on certain coins. M.
<a name="p150" id="p150"></a><span class="pagenum">Page 150</span>
Babelon shows that the drachma which bears one of these names, is a
manifest imitation of the drachmas of Datames; he also points out
that the inscription itself is plainly an alteration of the Aramean name
of Datames. The other name he proves to be a deformation of <i>Abrocomas</i>
and states his belief that neither of these supposed governors of
Cappadocia ever existed and cites other instances of the imitation of
coins and the alteration of inscriptions.--<i>Revue Numismatique</i>, III S.
tom. 10. II trim., 1892, p. 168.</p>
<br>

<p>HITTITE LETTER OF DUSRATTA.--Among the 300 letters from Tell-el-Amarna
is one written to Amenophis III by Dusratta, king of Mitani,
the region immediately east of the Euphrates. The letter which was
written on both sides of a clay tablet in cuneiform characters begins
with an introduction of seven lines in Assyrian, but the remaining
605 lines are in the native language of Dusratta.</p>

<p>The content refers to an embassy sent from Egypt to ask for the hand
of his daughter and to recognition of his conquests in Phœnicia. The
most important parts are those relating to his religion and to the affairs
of state. We find that the religion of the Hittites, Armenians and
Akkadians was probably the same as well as their language, which
was more nearly akin to pure Turkish than to any other branch of
Mongol speech. Dusratta was a Minyan and his power seems to have
been the chief in Armenia at this time.</p>

<p>From the letter we find that Dusratta was to receive a large portion
of Phoenicia and Northern Syria, which he was to rule as a tributary
of Amenophis III.
</p>
<p>The latter part of the letter refers to the marriage of Yadukhepa,
daughter of Dusratta, to the heir of Egypt, with assurances of increased
renewal of friendship between the kingdoms.</p>

<p>The letter is especially important because we may obtain from it, in
connection with the letter of Laskondam, also written in Hittite, many
of the forms of the Hittite language, its grammar and vocabulary of
400 words.</p>

<p>By these it is shown to be clearly a Mongol language, closely related
with the Akkadian, though somewhat later.--<i>Biblia</i>, Sept., 1892.</p>
<br>

<p>ANGORA.--At a meeting of the <i>Acad. des Inscr</i>. M.J. Menant exhibited
the rubbing of a Hittite bas-relief found at Angora, which is
now at Constantinople. It shows two personages, with an inscription
in Hittite characters by the side of each. One of them is the god
Sandu, to whom a king (with a name not yet deciphered) is making
an offering.</p>

<p>APAMΕΙΑ.--CHRISTIAN CHURCH.--Mr. G. Weber has published a study
of the early Christian church of Apameia (<i>Une église antique à Dinair</i>)
which he considers to be the earliest of which any remains exist in
Asia; he regards it as having been built under Constantine,--<i>Revue
Arch.</i>, 1892, 1, p. 131.</p>
<br>

<p>KARIA.--TEMPLE NEAR STRATONIKEIA--A large temple of Hecate was
found last year in Caria, near the ancient Stratonikeia (Eski Hissar).
Hamdi Bey, the director of the museum at Constantinople, has been
carrying on excavations. He has secured about 160 ft. of the sculptured
frieze complete, and has repaired the road to the coast ready for its
shipment. A member of the <i>École Française</i> has been invited by him
to assist him, and the results will be published by the School.--<i>Athenæum</i>, Oct. 1.</p>
<br>

<p>SEBASTOPOLIS.--M. Leon, the French vice-consul at Siwas, has communicated
to the <i>Acad. des Inscr.</i> the discovery of a series of Greek
inscriptions copied by him, which have enabled him to fix with certainty
the site of the ancient city of Sebastopolis. They also furnish
important information regarding its constitution.--<i>Athenæum</i>, Feb. 27.</p>
